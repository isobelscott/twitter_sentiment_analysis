There has got to be a way to make a lid that stays on, but isn't quite so hard to remove when a person wants to use it.  I appreciate being provided with a forum to voice my opinion\n",

       "I was considering purchasing a tablet and Wacom was consistantly recommended.  I was originally hesitant to buy the graphire line because I didnt think it would be very good for drawing compared to the top line (the intuos line).  I was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong.  Installing a driver was a piece of cake and I began drawing away in minutes.  It is very responsive and works with all my drawing programs (paintshop pro, painter, photoshop).  The mouse is pretty useless however, and I would have preferred if they had included some extra pen tips instead (they seem to wear out, though I do press pretty hard).  Other than that, its an amazing product\n",

The product description was a bit confusing as it seems like ti does a lot.  But what a surprise.   Just adjusting the brush size using the ipod like scroll disc on the device is worth the price.  The pop-up menu thing is cool.  I don't use it as much for putting tools, but putting my files and folders into that menu keeps things in one place.   I guess the product also lets you pan and zoom around, but I don't seem to use that as much.  I still like using my mouse to pan and zoom around.\n",

       "My new TV finally arrived and I am very pleased with it.  I picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews I could find online, the vast majority of which were very positive (cNet has lots of reviews as well).  Also, I have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of TVs, all day every day, and both of them bought this exact set for themselves.\n",
       "\n",
       "My cable provider does not offer many High Def stations yet so the image quality of Standard Def video was the primary criterion for me.  Most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite.  My first impression had me rather worried.  I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out.  I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others.  In fact, some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them.  I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time.  The video of the host looked OK, the video of one contributor was poor, and the video of the other contributor looked great.  The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen.  The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video.  I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs.\n",
       "\n",
       "The quality of the Hi Def Video is breath taking.\n",
       "\n",
       "Set-up was simple and I have not even bothered yet to read the manual.  Of course the display can be adjusted in many ways, but it looks good to me with the factory presets and I do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon.  Flipping through the on screen menu, I stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since I live at 10,000 ft. above sea level.\n",
       "\n",
       "I was a little disappointed with the delivery situation.  I thought I had ordered the TV in time to have it by opening day kick-off.  Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season, and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that.  I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this, not Amazon.  I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away.  But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks, and then in Denver for another week, before finally calling me to arrange for delivery.  I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay, it would have taken longer.  Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons: 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery, and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place.\n",

Well, after I exchanged my iTrip for a new one I tried it out on a short drive. I live in East Lansing, MI... and we have a very crowded FM dial. I couldn't find a completely blank station as recommended... but it didn't matter. My iTrip delivered decent sound through the station. As others have mentioned, charging your iPod while you use your FM transmitter will really help. It's not a night-and-day difference, but it's a noticeable improvement. Sure, I got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal, but you know what? Through a good 40 minutes of driving, the majority of the time I had satisfactory sound. This was also on the weaker-signaled LX mode, not DX. Supposedly DX provides a better, stronger signal. \n",
       "This product is dependant on several outside factors. The reception your car gets and the availability of a clear FM channel. To rate this product poorly because of factors out of it's control is unfair. There were times when I had downright poor sound... and times where it was comparable to a tape deck. I love good, crisp sound as much as anyone does... but I'll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday. \n",
       "\n",
       "My recommendation after owning this product for a short time *but it has been used quite a bit already, as I do a lot of driving*, I say: If you can, buy a tape deck adaptor... but if it's not an option and you don't want to put the money into an \"ipod to car\" setup, this is a viable solution indeed. In my opinion, an iTrip is a better option than listening to plain, old radio.\n",

       "I have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance. The Disaster Recovery software provided with this drive is it's biggest star. You can format your hard drive, put in the restore disk that you create for your system, and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to EXACTLY the way it was when you created the disk. Or you can simply replace selected files if you want. It does not miss a single thing. Fanstastic. The software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an \"ABC\" book. I would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use\n",

       "The intuos3 6x11 tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad. The mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks, opening programs is one of them. It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I'm drawing my finger frequently hits it, because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price. I would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet, it is nice to have if you have the desk space. I've heard Wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that I own one I believe it\n",

       "I wouldn't be without this. When I first bought the 20d it was my first digital SLR and I spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap. In the end I settled for using both and wouldn't have it any other way. With the battery grip and hand strap in place I find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold. That's all there is to it, that's what it does and it does it well. \n",
       "\n",
       "On the down side, and it's a small and transient down side, actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you'd sort of expect it to be insecure. I think the trick, security wise, is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first, then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap (if used). I also don't like the attachment to the neck strap, I don't like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use.\n",
       "\n",
       "I use this on a 20d which typically has a 24-200 or 80-400 lens attached. You can only use this if you also use the battery grip, or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location. But since I always use the battery grip I don't have an issue. \n",
       "\n",
       "If Canon read this, you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price, you normally pay close attention to detail and it's a bit lacking here\n",

       "This is an excellent machine.  I bought two of them.  There are a few things you need to do.  I have had 100% satisfaction using FujiFilm DVD-R up to 8x.  I have had success with FujiFilm DVD+R up to 8x.  I`ve also had tremendous success with TDK DVD+R up to 4x and 8x.  Some other brands may not work.  One thing I`ve learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little.  Don`t go recording 3 or 4 -R or +R DVDs every day.  Give it a rest between recordings.  One or two per day is okay.  Definitely give it room to breathe.  If you stack your machines on top of each other, put something in between so they can breathe.  Be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides.  You definitely need to buy a Panasonic DVD player to play back your DVDs - other brand DVD players may not play your recordings properly.\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the greatest things about this machine is that it records DVD-RAM.  They are re-recordable for many, many times and each program can be erased when watched.  You can even edit the recordings on the DVD-RAM.  Cut out commercials and fit more on a disc or remove the commercials for when you watch the program.  Only works on the DVD-RAM.  I have over 50 DVD-RAM discs (Panasonic brand) - they sure take up less space than VCR tapes!\n",
       "\n",
       "Get one or two of these recorders and a Panasonic DVD player and you`ve got it made!  Throw away your VCRs forever!  Just remember to baby them\n",

       "I bought this for my folks for Christmas.  It took no time at all to hook up, and making DVDs was simple.  Everything from recording off the TV, to recording movies and shows stored on the DVR, to transferring home movies from the original VHS tapes.  I'm sure for about $300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders, but for under $200, you really can't go wrong.  The only flaw I could find is that the initial hookup (according to the book) didn't seem quite right.  After taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online, everything went smoothly.  Because of that, I'm still going to give it a full 5 stars..it's not as if those 2 whole minutes ruined our life.  Really, if you're new to this technology, you're not going to have any problems..believe me..A++\n",

       "The other effusive reviews are spot-on...  the picture is fabulous on new DVDs (Lord of the Rings, Nemo, Harry Potter).  A $20 Cables to Go HDMI cable does a great job.  We have the  Sony KDF-42E2000 42\" 3LCD Rear Projection HDTV and are thrilled with the combination.  A few annoyances:  The machine responds and loads slowly, but that's not too bad; a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price.  And, certain DVDs of old movies (Some Like it Hot, The King and I) stretch the picture horizontally, making things look squat.  I'm sure there's a solution, but just can't figure it out.

With the software tools that are provided you can sharpen and correct VHS that has degraded and bring back life as when it was first transfered to tape. I have taken many VHS tapes that were never released as DVD and now have the start of a great library. Editing is a little tricky until you get the hang of it. The product works well. IPOD old music videos and movies for a real treat. Sound is perfect\n",

The washer turned out to be one of those machines that had one problem after another sometimes the same.  N.E.W. used a couple of different service companies to repair it and finally wrote it off.  Throughout, N.E.W. was great and made every effort to fix the machine.  When the finally wrote it off they sent me a check for the amount that I paid for it.  They did not try to discount the settlement price for the time that I actually had the machine\n",

       "I've owned many Sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy Walkmen, useful shortwave and portable radios, stylish TVs and high quality cassette recorders.  I still have a Sony mini component stereo model FH-E656 (made in Japan) which I bought in 1992 for US$400+; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out CD player, I decided to purchase this new Sony MHCEC70 component stereo (made in China).\n",

       "good functionality\n",

       "CONS:\n",
       "very short speaker leads\n",
       "unattractive styling (for my tastes) -- resembles a boombox\n",
       "only holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic units\n",
       "\n",
       "At first glance, I was disappointed by the cheap construction, skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies.  But then I thought: in 2006 for $150, I can't expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $400.  Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China.  So, for the money, it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom.  The real test will be how long the CD changer works -- to be safe, this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty.  I haven't blasted it at full volume, but it seems to have plenty of power when needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "I originally bought a $300 Panasonic unit (SC-PM71SD MP3 SD Micro System) which was returned because it didn't have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by DRM limitations).  This Sony stereo costs half as much, and has almost all the same functionality\n",

Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available, even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also, the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is \"admin\". Well, it's not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes.\n",
       "3. Something that 99% of the world won't care about -- I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other Linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it's attached to. I think there are third-party firmware loads that enable this\n",

That person chose to buy it without and save some $$ and then complained about having to pay extra for it because he/she bought the wrong software package.  Delorme did the right thing and offered us options.  I just ordered mine and I have no plans on using with a HH so I'm very happy that I didn't have to buy the HH software.  Just don't be dumb and read what you are buying before you buy it.  Nemerous people have highly recommended this to me, although I have heard that MS Mappoint has better maps and should be used instead when you have it as an option.  Storing 50,000 data points without a connection to a computer is awesome.  I will be able to take the unit with me on a bike ride and analize the workout later hopefully looking at the route, elevation, etc.  Too bad it is only in Yellow..\n",

This card is one fast sucker, and it can hold an enormous amount of images. In JPEG mode I am able to store over 1000 images. In RAW mode, which I'm converting to thanks to this large capacity card, I am able to hold 444 images all on my 20D!!! If your thinking of buying this card, don't hesitate.

       "These earphones are the best I ever had. I never had to try other pairs of earphone because I absolutely loved these that I keep buying it! After 6 years I buy the same one everytime. Of course I never use the winding case and it just sits there but heck it usually stores my other earphones that I brought but can't seem to throw them out because it costed money. It seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and I can answer why thats happening. It's actually static electricity. I experienced it myself a couple of times because I was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form. It's actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones I suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked. The bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones. Hey for 10 bucks or less you can't except Sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model. I abuse my earphones so for 10 bucks a year I think these are the best rather than buying something thats $100 dollars or over and later regret it because it got either lost, broken or stolen.\n",

The door that covers the slot, however, is very flimsy and easily deattaches (but fortunately easily reattaches too?) I use Mac OS X 10.4.8 and it works just fine.

       "I purchased the Adorama Slinger Bag after first purchasing the Tamrac Velocity 5.  The Tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag. Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag, it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.  There are two water pouches on the Slinger Bag (which is a real requirement as I live in Arizona).\n",

       "I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) \n",
       "\n",
       "The variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. \n",
       "\n",
       "The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.\n",

       "With boys aged 2 &amp; 3, and some poor disc storage procedures when I'm driving, it appeared I was in need of one of these units.  Generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs, but it occassionally happens, and doesn't take long for scratches, damage and finger prints to hinder performance, and when changing children's cds in the car I don't always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also.  I read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products, and finally decided on this unit because it runs on a/c power, is fully contained and automatic, and was about $10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit.  Both items had mixed reviews - mostly positive, but I found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all, and one that skipped.  \n",
       "\n",
       "This product repairs a disc to \"useable\" condition, it does not repair it so that scratches are not visible.  I can still see, but not necessarily feel the scratches.  It's also important to remember that some scratches do not affect performance.  If a disc plays well, but shows scratches - I just clean off the finger prints with a cloth or use the unit to clean the disc and see if the performance is satisfactory before attempting a full repair.  \n",
       "\n",
       "I agree that the instructions with the unit could be better. I saved the instructions provided by another reviewer to use with the provided instructions for clarity. Also, some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair, so I agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items - but it is possible.  I noticed that I could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the buffing/sanding (pink disc) process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair.  I ran one disc through 3 times in a row, then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine.  My lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great.  I usually clean the disc (manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime), then buff, then repair.  It can be time consuming to repair a disc to functioning, but it does save the disc and my discs play like new despite the scratches that are still visable.  I think this was good purchase and not overly complicated to use. \n",

       "I've read other reviews for this product that have people complaining about losing their data when the batteries are changed. THIS IS NOT TRUE if you're carefull.  First of all, my ebookman came with a bright blue warning flier stating that your ebookman needs to be turned OFF when you change the batteries.  Pretty simple, huh?  Also, don't wait for your battery to completely die before you change it. The main menu screen has a battery meter in the bottom right hand corner, and I just switch out the batteries when the meter reaches 10%.  I primarily use my ebookman to read ebooks and I love it\n",

       "I'll try to keep this short and sweet.  If you have been frustrated trying to get AM reception on the go, then you've found the right radio for you.  I can't tell you how many pieces of junk I've bought that barely pulled-in even relatively close AM stations unless I constantly twisted the radio to the perfect angle needed to get reception.   Luckily (?) those other radios also died pretty quickly. This Sangean product solves the AM reception problem and seems very durable. I also own their CCRadio and this pocket product lives up to its reputation.  I love the fact that it also gives you the option to broadcast through the built-in speaker, just like transistor radios of the 50's and 60's--a seemingly forgotten feature.  As for listening through the supplied earphones, forget it. Sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied.  Never have I heard tinnier sound, even for AM listening.  Not not mention that the cord is annoyingly short.  I immediatey invested another $35 in decent pair of Koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin.  Now I happily and easily listen to AM and FM stations even over the roar of the lawnmower.   There might be alternatives for those of you who plan on listening to FM exclusivey, but if you spend even a little time on the AM dial, I really don't think you have a choice but to pick up this radio\n",

       "I could only start with at 2.1 set up - L/C/R and no sub woofer.  Great digital sound effects with a one button switch to stereo for easy comparison.\n",
       "\n",
       "Tons of input/output connectors.  Unless you need HDMI, the available connectors are perfect.  The speaker connectors are screw down/banana plug type for easy, secure connection.  Lots of component video, S-VHS and RCA video inputs.  Lots of analog audio connections AND two digital coax and one optical.  I use the digital coax for my DVD/CD and for my cable box.  \n",
       "\n",
       "Really easy set up.  I could assign inputs to the various selections through the front of the receiver.  The manual is written in easy to understand language with lots of pictures.\n",
       "\n",
       "Did I mention the sound.  Frys offers Polk Audio R15 for an indecently low price.  With this receiver the sound is rich - great bass and treble without any tweaking of levels.  Adding a Cerwin Vega center channel brought out the digital sound effects and this has them all.\n",
       "\n",
       "Best of all, my fashion master wife pulled the receiver out of the box before I got home and pronounced it beautiful.  It was the only low profile receiver I could find that fit in the armoire we use as an enterntainment station.\n",
       "\n",
       "The end result - I sat down and just watched Hellboy for the first time all over again in the middle of the installation.  All for less than the cost of me and the Missus going to the movies for a few weekends.  Get this receiver\n",

       "\n",
       "Though I have not had the opportunity to test the ultra-high (up to 50kHz) frequency, the highs on these speakers sound very well, maybe only slightly boxy - note that the speakers are rather directional so the sound does not spread.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sound is very flat. The lack of depth makes it feel as if the sound is coming from a flat wall or a small box rather than from a space, especially if you stand further away (over 5 ft.) from the speakers. It seems that the speakers have a much lower than published sensitivity level. However, don't get discouraged because with most speakers/headphones it may be that the speakers need some time to burn in (loosen the diaphragm) to get a bit more \"sustain\" to their output rather than seem to have a very sharp cutoff.\n",
       "\n",
       "The bass is very punchy, and not deep. I would definitely recommend a subwoofer for these speakers, as their highs are very good, and midranges are nice but maybe a bit flat. The subwoofer will party compensate for the problem, and you could even completely cut off the bottom frequency band and suffer little ill effect (use the LFE on your receiver for the sub-woofer... don't worry, low frequency bass is not perceived by humans as directional so your surround or stereo won't suffer). In other words, you will need a lot of tweaking and additions to make these sound nicer than their out-of-the box quality.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ignore the 50kHz rating for ultra-high-frequency sound as a positive feature, as no receiver you will buy at the budget for these speakers will be rated for that output. Most are rated for 20 Hz - 20kHz, at a reasonable RMS.\n",
       "\n",
       "You get what you pay for... for the price tag on them, the SSMF650H are good. They perform reasonably well on highs and mids (but in no means studio reference sound), and are crisp and punchy on the bass. They do however seem to lack depth and have low sensitivity - especially so on the bass... the further you move away from them (and especially if you stand up above them), the sound quality suffers.\n",
       "\n",
       "I would recommend Wharfedale Diamond 8.4 speakers as a better choice if you're willing to expand your budget a bit. Polk is also not a bad choice for cheap sound.\n",
       "\n",
       "I also demo-ed the ~$100 per pair CAT SDAT LEB-404 (I think I saw them on overstock for $80 with free shipping). They are a bit shady, but excellent for the price - seems that the 20 Hz bass rating on them is actually somewhat accurate. If you're looking for deep and bass-heavy sound without a sub-woofer, and are willing to take a hit on mids and highs a bit this is your \"budget solution\" instead of the SS-MF650H. I was pleasantly surprised. They also have poor sensitivity though, so if you have a big room shop around for something better.\n",

       "I listen to a wide range of music, from hard rock, techno/electronic, to classical, and I've found it difficult to locate reasonably priced speakers that can handle all of this -- at least until I ordered this set.  I was apprehensive about buying online (and also about the Sony brand for speakers), but I'm very happy with this purchase.  I've been very impressed with the sound both at the high and low ends - the highs are crisp and the bass is tight, not boomy.  The soundstage is expansive (of course, this depends a lot on your receiver as well) and imaging good.  I'd definitely recommend this speaker set\n",

The first time I listened to music on these I was able to pick out the click of the pick against the guitar string, something I'd never heard before on that song.  In fact, I blame these headphones on my new addiction to, well, headphones.\n",

       "These obviously can't play as loudly as $200 headphones, and lack a little of the very lowest and very highest reach, but everything in the middle is VERY good.  I don't think you can find headphones that are this nice to listen to for under $100.  And being under $20, you can buy a pair to try without feeling like you might be wasting a lot of money.  I should go work for these guys or something =)\n",

       "I think this is as good as the expensive over $60 HDMI cables.  I wouldn't spend money on the expensive ones.  First of all, I'm not a cable junkie nor an expert.  However, according to my research, there's no difference in performance b/w the expensive version nor the $12, $15, $20 version when it comes to HDMI since it's all digital.. hole buch of zeros and ones.  The durability of the cables... I don't know.  But unless you're someone who constantly plugs and unplugs the cables for some reason, it wouldn't matter.  Normally, you'd connect the cable and keep it that way for a long period of time, so the durability is not really relevant.  Bottomline: This is as good as the expensive ones.  I first tried out the expensive Monster brand which was $85.  Then I returned it after purchasing this, for the quality was the same.  Don't buy the expensive ones\n",

This has helped too lessen the pressure they put on my ears and head to the point that they are now OK to wear for long periods.  NOTE: this procedure is at your own risk, as I do not think it is officially endorsed by the mfg.  ;-)   Do not overstretch them, as the headband material, while flexible, undoubtedly has limits to the stretch it can take.\n",

So Google it, download it, and buy the USB drive. The size of this USB drive and the fact that you'll never have to worry about losing the cap along with an excellent price make it worth buying. After you uninstall the U3 software, it works like any other drive. It works great, it just takes you ten minutes of a little extra work. \n",

       "I bought these headphones a week ago and I am very pleased with them. At the electronic store, I listen to 3 pairs of Sennheiser (HD-433 ; HD-437 and HD-457). I hesitated between the 437 and the 457 but went for the 457 (10 more buck$). At the store the sound was OK as they were playing from the Sennheiser display rack. When I got home, I plugged these in my computer soundcard jack and the sound was a whole lot better. I am very impressed of the volume and sound quality I can get from them on my computer. My soundcard is an onboard Soundmax AC97 on an Asus K8V-X motherboard. I set the sound option in Windows XP on \"headphones\" and played \"Metallica- Nothing else matters\" with WinAmp. WOW !!! I was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general. I only use half of the volume available in Windows XP and it`s more than enough for me.\n",
       "I do agree with some other reviews that the bass could be more precise but I found out that it varies a lot depending of the sound source you`re using. The sound is better on  my computer than on my Harman Kardon amplifier and is a lot better on my MP3 player than with the earbuds that came with it.\n",
       "Overall, I would say that these headphones are very good for the inexpensive price. They blow away all the competition in the same price range. Compared to my old Panasonic, it`s a drastic improvement especially for the bass response.\n",
       "When it comes to music, I love bass a lot but I would recommand to others that you would listen to them from a source that you could adjust the bass level (bass knob or equalizer), so that way you won`t get too much bass from them.\n",
       "Very good headphones ... Go get a pair ... at this price you can`t go wrong. I highly recommand them for computer users (music, DVD movies and games)\n",

       "I am a success coach and I record all my coaching calls as a standard practice. This recorder has performed fantastically in all situations. I get about 9 - 12 continuous hours of battery operation (depending on battery quality) and the unit captures voices flawlessly during my calls (I have an adapter for the phone). I have used this in a seminar setting and have had great results. I highly recommend using rechargeable batteries (always have one extra on hand) when you are going to use the unit for extended periods of time. Recharge before your event each day and you won't miss a thing. The unit only uses one battery and it's always a great idea to have a spare. The unit does not audibly warn when the battery is about to expire, so keeping a fresh charge should provide you with uninterrupted recordings. Each stop and restart begins a new file. For me that works great! If you are looking for one continuous file, do not shut it off. You can also buy software that will let you merge the files for your later use. You would be hard pressed to find a better product for the money\n",

       "It's not listed in the product description but the Pico works with the iPod Mini too.  Like the other reviewers, I found it easy to setup: tune the radio, turn on iPod, connect the Pico, tune the Pico, done).  In my car, the static interference was less noticeable when the unit was placed in close proximity to the radio.  I noticed this as well with my home stereo. Maybe the next generation Pico needs a larger antennae, or my iPod needed charging.  Regarding sound quality, my other car has a built-in iPod connector.  The Pico sound quality is comparable, somewhat muted, but enjoyable.  The Pico does offer the advantage of displaying the iPod menu to select tunes.  I've read mixed reviews on other FM transmitters, but I am pleased with the Pico\n",

       "I was looking for an inexpensive, yet high quality, long lasting, and durable way to identify dozens upon dozens of electrical wires behind the instrument panel of my airplane. A fellow pilot made me aware of the family of small electronic labelers available in the marketplace. The Brother 1750 fits my needs perfectly. Offering two lines of crisp, highly readable print gives a professional appearance to all labeling needs. My experience is quite different than some reviewers who have complained about wasted tape. In fact, I found that little wasted tape is generated if you simply adjust the margins to a particular task and this option is clearly spelled out in the instruction booklet. Since I purchased the 1750, I have found many uses for it around the home office and I wonder how I got by without one in the past! My only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters, it does not offer a dash or hyphen, so when one is  required, I find myself using a star instead. That is a minor complaint though.  The Brother 1750 gets considerable mileage on AA battery power alone, so I have not felt the need to purchase the adapter\n",

       "I was paranoid about having buyer's remorse from this unit. For such a cheap price I was sure I would end up regretting the purchase. What is the tradeoff? Shoot if know, but I haven't regretted buying it one bit. The receiver is perfect for home theater, particularly DD 5.1 shows. There is absolutely no discernable speaker hiss with digital content, which is important for TV watching that has a high range of both loud and silent moments.\n",

       "I purchased this receiver from Fry's Electronics in San Diego, CA for $199.99. At first, I was a little hesitant about purchasing an all digital receiver. When I got it home, and connected it, I was amazed. This receiver will blow you away with the precision of it's home theater capabilities. I am using four Polk R30's as my fronts, and rear surround, and two Sony center channels for my front center, and rear center channels. I also have a KLH 10inch Tremor Series powered subwoofer. I estimate the entire system to cost about $650.00 total. I have colleague that has a Bose home theater system, and my little system blows his out of the water, and he paid much more for the Bose. If you want a great receiver a minimal price, this is the way to go. By the way, did I mention that it has four digital inputs, an optical output, and HDMI in and out connections. BUY IT!!!\n",

       "I've had 2 other FM transmitters (A Belkin and a Griffin iTrip). Neither came close to the quality of this transmitter. Neither charged the iPod (The Belkin required batteries, which only lasted about 15 hours of use), while the iTrip worked OK at first, but then started getting static no matter what station I used. In fact, I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away (and then, it was still not clear). The sound isn't as loud as some (it takes over the volume control, so you cant use the volume on the iPod.) Still, it's not nearly as soft as some I've seen. I found most music came through at a good volume (I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up). This unit, although it seems cheap and flimsy at first, is able to get a consistant, strong signal, even on stations which usually come in clearly. It powers through them, and the result is a very clean sound. It is a little hard to read at the regular angle, but once you set the 3 presets, you don't need to see the screen. Just set your radio to the same 1-2-3 configuration. Also, turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer. In all, I couldn't be happier\n",

Listening to music at extremely high bit rates and using the optical connection from my Macbook Pro truly does some incredible things.

       "I found the sound fantastic. Just got these after usinf Shure E3s for about a year. I liked those but find these even better. When I first tried them I found the base so much stronger than the E3s as many have alluded to. Now I run my iPod at normal equalizer settings. I find the balance of the set dead on. The fit is great, of course your milage may vary. In fact they are so good at excluding air conduction that bone conduction becomes very noticable. This means when I walk with them I can hear my footsteps. This would be a real problem if I jogged (low impact workouts such as elipticals and bicycles are not affected)\n",

It works right out of the box, you'll be ready to go within seconds. The sound is crisp, with some static interference, which can be expected in a big city. Unmounting my car's antenna helps a little but doesn't completely cure the interference. I have a factory BMW Business radio which picks up FM signals pretty much without an antenna.\n",

       "I have had my Axim x51v for about three months.  I purchased it from Dell for $480 with aluminum hardcase, extra 1100mAh battery, and auto power cord.\n",
       "\n",
       "Strengths: Just about everything.  The processor is absolutely incredible.  I heard (unconfirmed) that the Intel 624 MHz PXA270 is faster than a 2GHz Pentium 3!  It sure seems like it.  This PDA blazes through movies, photos, games, word processing, and anything else I can throw at it.  \n",
       "The other definite high point for this PDA is the screen.  Once you see a VGA screen like this, you will be astounded at the difference it can make over a QVGA screen.  I have to get about 4 inches from the screen to even see the pixels.  The screen is crystal clear.  \n",
       "The battery life is phenomenal, even with the standard low capacity battery.  Playing a movie at full brightness and full volume will last about 2 hours, extended to about 4.5 hours on low brightness and headphones.  Turned off with a 1GB SD card drains the battery about 2% per day.  \n",
       "WiFi is amazing.  It connects consistently and is moderately easy to set up.  Once connected, it keeps the signal well and is, while not fast, reasonable for speed\n",
       "Just about everything on this PDA is almost perfect.\n",
       "\n",
       "Weaknesses: Not enough programs to start with, Windows Media Player 10 (Download TCPMP, it's way better)\n",
       "\n",
       "Problems: Don't use Odyssey Client, it makes the PDA start up really slow.  Also, in ActiveSync, On the PDA, select Menu, Add Server Source.  On all of the screens, put random characters in each field, and deselect any check boxes that tell it what to synchronize.  Then go to menu, schedule and select manual for both.  Then go to menu, options, and delete the entry that you just added (the one that has no boxes under it checked) and delete it.  It fixes a myriad of problems and makes the PDA run faster, and it still syncs automatically in the cradle.\n",
       "\n",
       "Conclusion: An awesome PDA that does just about everything.  Combine it with a BT keyboard and perhaps even a BT mouse, and you have an unbeatable combination of power and portability.  Everything works extremely well\n",

       "Like most people here, I found the Bose Triport headphones to have excellent sound but the plastic on mine also broke in the recess next to the earcups.  What I found is that this is caused by the tension of the headband frame pushing into the plastic.  In fact, the plastic broke from just sitting in my drawer for a week with the headband fully extended.\n",

Bose replaced them with no hassles, no receipt, no registration, just sent them back and got a brand new pair.  I think that was well worth the money spent over 2 years ago\n",

       "I recently received the Zen Microphoto as a gift.  Since I travel fairly often, I decided to purchase the Traveldock after reading the reviews.  It's great.  The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply.  The sound is rich, loud enough, and better than any other travel speakers that I own.  Many people comment on the bass issue.  For travel speakers, the Traveldock has the best bass to date, in my opinion.  True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative's website).  I'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience.  The jacks are easy to reach and use, which are on the back of the unit.  Also, the Microphoto charges while docked, whether it's playing or not.  There's even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also).  By the way, it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3's, adjust volume, and play/pause/FF/Rew.  Overall, this is a very nice addition to the Zen Microphoto.\n",

       "Again, Creative Labs has combined all you need into one package: line in jack, usb port, fm antenna, and even a jack for a sub-woofer! for a small portable speaker, this system gets pretty loud and clear. The stereo effect button works great, the design is very stylish and the remote is a nice finishing touch. now for the cons;like most reviewers,i too, have to say the bass is lacking a bit, and the stand has a bit of trouble holding the speakers up due to small rubber feet that doesnt grip very well. and the last thing is the speakers itself doesnt have any grill or guard on it and it looks like it could be damaged easily, but these are minor things i can overlook and all in all for the price, this speaker system is very good.    \n",
       "i tried the Altec Lansing portable speakers for the same price and i returned it the next day. it didnt even get half as loud without distortion and it didnt have as many cool features either.\n",
       "right now, im using the speakers with the zen nano plus and it works great! im saving up for the zen micro now and if it sounds good with the nano, then i know the TravelDock will sound amazing with the micro that it was intended for.\n",
       " one more thing, if your going to use the line-in cable for a device other than the zen micro, be sure to insert the BLACK end of the cable into the device your want to play and the WHITE end into the speakers line-in jack. i read a reviewer who said the speakers sounded tinny like a transistor radio and its because she had the wrong ends of the cable attached. i did it myself and i figured it out. unlike the reviewer who returned the speakers before taking the time to learn how to use it before returning it and giving it a bad review. \n",

       "Echoing most other reviews here, this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money.  But buying them is a risk! If you don't wear these earphones correctly, they sound terrible, easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones.  Those unsatisfied with the sound quality (especially those complaining of lack of bass) either haven't put them in correctly or have oddly shaped ears.\n",
       "\n",
       "Learning how to put them in properly takes time.  Be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions.  Once you teach yourself how to put them in, it will only take a few seconds.  Some tips: Before inserting the earbuds, draw the phones up from behind your ear, holding the earbuds in the correct orientation (drivers pointing medially), so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals. With one hand, pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other.  This straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone.  (Your doctor uses the same maneuver when he/she examines you with an otoscope.) You may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better.  If the phones are properly inserted, they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your Eustachian tubes (that is, swallow), just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator.\n",
       "\n",
       "It may seem like it takes a lot of work (and possibly learning a bit about anatomy) to get these earphones to work as intended.  It does, and success is not guaranteed.  But it's worth it! And to save your hearing, don't forget to turn down the volume, since your music will no longer have to compete with outside noise\n",

The first time, I looked at the Westinghouse the picture looked a bit fuzzy. Then I read the review on CNET which said the Westinghouse picture was actually better than the Sharp. I went back to Best Buy and asked the sales person if the picture on the Westinghouse could be improved. He said it was as it good as it could be. He than said the Sharp was twice the price of the Westinghouse, so I should expect a better picture on the Sharp.In any event, I purchased the Sharp on Amazon during the recent Electronic Express Sale. On HD, the picture is amazing. It's also quite good on regular TV. \n",
       "My only regret is that Toshiba has just come out with a 37inch LCD with a DVD built in. If I  had known, I would have waited to check out that model\n",

My complaint is that this radio advertises itself as picking up weak stations very clearly.  It does not pick up stations much better then the other radios in my house.  Also if you are listening to the radio you can't see the time display.\n",

When I called their office for advice, one of the tech guys (excellent service, by the way) told me the Monster banana plugs were great, not the best or most expensive available, but a good value. That was enough for me. My speakers are bi-wired so I purchased two sets of four plugs. Installation was a snap and the sound is wonderful. Add to that the free shipping, no tax and a total price saving of $12.00 and you can't do better than Amazon!\n",

       "This is an awesome little MP3 player.  I enjoy both the MP3 player and the FM radio.  It is very easy to use and syncs well with Windows Media Player.  It is perfect for going to the gym because it is so small.  It came with a great leather case that fits it well and prevents damage and scratches.  My only problem with the player is that I can't fit more than 66-69 songs although it says there is about 70MB of space left on the player\n",

       "Yeah, so apparently this was a really good PDA to buy. I BOUGHT THIS THREE YEARS AGO AND IT STILL WORKS! Ive been searching for a new PDA since I thought this one was so out of date, and when reading all the reviews I came across many new \"state of the art\" PDAs that broke after only a few months. This baby has been great to me for three long years, so if you are looking for a reliable buy, go for this. Definately NOT flashy, very basic. All I use it for is appointments, dates, and to-dos. GREAT FOR STUDENTS WHO WANT TO USE A PDA AS AN AGENDA! \n",

       "Netgear clearly has not figured out how to make their RangeMax adapter work well with the Microsoft XP operating system.  If you're not a techie, I'd stay away until Microsoft has certified the WPN311. Here's what I experienced:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Installed using the Netgear WPN311 automated configuration.\n",
       "2. After installation completion and boot up, CPU utilization was at a solid 100%.  Executable from Netgear named WLANCFG5.EXE taking up a bunch of the CPU and Microsoft routines CSRSS.EXE, NET.EXE, and NET1.EXE taking the rest.\n",
       "3. Emailed Netgear and received response to use Task Manager to delete WLANCFG5.EXE.  Did so for all users.\n",
       "4. Hey!  CPU utilization returned to normal!\n",
       "5. Sent next email to Netgear pointing out that this solution is just a \"patch\" and WLANCFG5 would return when I re-booted.\n",
       "6. Received response to de-install and re-install software for WPN311.\n",
       "7. Did so, but then Netgear adapter software could not find my MIMO wireless router!  And usage of the Netgear adapter software doesn't allow you to use the Microsoft Wireless Zero Configurator (WZC).\n",
       "8. Went to microsoft.com and looked up error 871122 \"Error message when you try to run the Wireless Network Setup Wizard\" and followed the instruction to allow usage of WZC.\n",
       "9. Then able to add my wireless router and everything is ok.\n",

       "\n",
       "Pros:\n",
       "1. Very good bass &amp; well balance (not as bloated as the Sony EX71, the ER4p has tight but the least bass-feel/effect.)  Mid-range is good. Treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box (but can be tamed with EQ.)\n",
       "2. Easy to drive (with the iM716 phones, I'd need to crank up the vol.)\n",
       "3. Very light weight\n",
       "4. Comfortable tips (3 sizes included)\n",
       "5. Decent isolation from outside noise (the ER4p &amp;iM716 have better isolation)\n",
       "6. Moderately priced ($50)\n",
       "\n",
       "Cons:\n",
       "1. Cables are thin so handle with care.\n",
       "2. Some people may not like the \"phonendoscope effect\" (cables frictions.)  This is very common with IEM headphones, some are more than others.\n",
       "3. No pouch or case\n",
       "\n",
       "PS: For bass-heads, you will like these IEMs - from an owner of Beyer DT770-80's experience :\n",

       "All in-ear headphones will make some noise when the wires brush up against something.  Sound travels along wires... it's physics, there's nothing you can do about that.  Now, these earphones are incredibly light-weight and the wires are thin so that actually reduces the noise traveling through the wires.  \n",
       "\n",
       "These headphones are called \"asymmetric,\" meaning that the right earbud is on a longer wire than the left.  You wear this by putting the wire on the right earbud BEHIND your neck.  This leaves the area in front of you clear of wires that could get tangled up in your hands.  This also makes it easy to each lunch while listening to music so your food doesn't spill on the wire.\n",
       "\n",
       "I paid about 60 bucks and for that price, I love these headphones.  Face it, these are low to mid-range in terms of price, but perform more like mid-range to high range if you ask me.  The cable is thin and flexible yet seems pretty resistant to damage.  The buds are comfy and I like the asymmetric design.  People need to realize that there are premium headphones for $500 or more.  I think people need to keep perspective and not have TOO high expectations from only a $60 pair\n",

       "I love the new nanos. I don't think I have anything bad to say about it besides it not having a radio. It is small and very thin. You barely feel it in your pocket, which might annoy some people but not me. I'd rather get this than any Zen products or Sandisk Sansas because it looks way better and it way thinner. The screen is really bright with the full color display. The new earbuds are A LOT more comfortable than the old ones. The new ones aren't as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out. I don't know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me! The new color coating is scratch resistant, but not the click wheel and the Apple symbol. But you don't notice the scratches on the white parts. The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano, 24 hours! The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos. I'm so happy I waited after the 1st gen nanos came out. I would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily, have a dark screen, and have a short battery life. The new nanos are great deals and great gifts. I recommend this mp3 player to anyone that wants a good, reliable, scratch resistant, cool looking music player! 5/5 star\n",

       "These Verbatim discs have the DataLife Plus layer of protection that will allow them to last 100+ years. I'm a professional photographer and it's crucial to store my client's digital photos and artwork onto a disc that will remain stable in years to come. I've tried many brands and types of discs and have lost data (read errors) many times but so far with the hundreds of Verbatim discs I've burned so far, I haven't had a problem yet. The Kodak brand discs were also excellent, but Kodak discontinued making them. SONY also makes a good disc. These discs can be printed on directly with an ink jet printer such as the Epson R200/R300/R320, and the surface area is printable right up to the hub! I have no reason to switch to any other brand as long as Verbatim continues to make a great disc\n",

       "These Verbatims are terrific.  As you may know, working with DVD-R media is almost a gamble...cheap media will save you a few pennies but either give you coasters or media that plays on few players.  Sticking to name brands helps, but even then, some brands rely on outside sources for their media and while one lot/batch may be good, the next batch from the same brand may be from somewhere else.  Usually, you're safe with media made in Japan.  These Verbatim's are made in Taiwan but, they are great..I've bought one every couple months and I'm on my 3rd spindle now.\n",
       "\n",
       "They have a wonderful printing surface that as mentioned, dries nearly instantly in Epson printers (I use an R200).  Hub printable so you can print all the way to the edge which gives your discs a terrific look when printing nice disc art or photos.  Not one coaster so far, burned with Apple Powerbook 2X Superdrive as well as a Lacie D2 Firewire writer. Though the media is 8X, it works in my Panasonic DVD Recorder (DMR-E55) which recommends up to 4X media perfectly).  So far, I have not encountered one person who has not been able to play the discs (Samsung, Sanyo, Panasonic, Sony, Apex, Toshiba DVD Players, PS2, XBox, no problems) .  Over 134 discs so far, and they look great, play great, and are a great price for hub printable discs.   Highly recommended...I'm ordering more!\n",

       "Notebooks Pro is the highest rated webcam (for notebooks) on the market and for good reason.  Audio and Video quality is excellent.  You can talk normal and be 2 or 3 feet away with no problem.  The echo cancellation feature is a true must for webcams, especially with the use of video.  On the negative side the USB cable is too short which limits interchangeability with your desktop.  Also, I have the Quickcam Fusion for my desktop which is a 5 star rated product and without doubt the best of the best webcams overall.  Logitech ships that product with Quickcam 10 software which is probably a nice update to Quickcam 9 the Notebook Pro uses.  Unfortunately, Logitech provides little detail and info on these technical and software issues.  B\n",

       "I am running the RadioShark on a G4 PowerBook w/ Mac OS X 10.4.  I am very happy with the programmed recording - saves to a variety of formats, etc. Very handy! The unit did all that it promised, but it could have had much better software. A Dashboard Widget is also included that controls basic operation, but not recording or EQ.\n",
       "\n",
       "Needed additions:\n",
       "1. Station presets are selected from a drop down menu??!? One has to go to the RS menu bar (top of screen) to find the favorite Stations - kind of klunky. Better to have \"radio buttons\" associated with the App window. To be fair, the Widget does have better station selection, but the button is labeled with a 'heart'...\n",
       "2. No station \"scan\" function. One has to dink through the entire spectrum manually - wow - hard to understand this lack of functionality.\n",
       "3. Some additional audio filter/edit functions could be included. There is a multi-band EQ that works well, mostly (see comment below). At minimum there should be a hiss filter and a hum filter with variable levels of effect. Also, one should be able to edit out unessential material from an audio file. Though, for Mac OS X there is a nice freeware app that can do this:  AUDACITY.\n",
       "\n",
       "Oddities\n",
       "1. When first installed, the output had static in it which was worse with the EQ on. Griffin Tech Support was not very helpful - as with most tech support offerings, they failed to grasp the actual problem and replied with unhelpful suggestions. Re-installed software and it began working well.\n",
       "2. Initially did not seem to work well thru an external (powered) hub; now has no problems. Though, unit does work okay with a USB extension cable\n",

       "I have been going nuts trying to find a decent set of headphones for my new iPod.  All I wanted was decent sound for a decent price, but after trying various models of ear-buds and standard phones and returning them all I figured I was going to have to shell out some big bucks after all.  But, then I decided to pull the trigger on some cans made by a great old company from my youth that used to be THE only choice for headphones- KOSS of course!  And man- they still have it.  These aren't the greatest phones I've ever heard, but for $20 (and it seems you can now get them for half that!) they easily compare to some well-known sets costing 3 times as much or more.  Finally, no awful hi-mid peaks that threaten to end my career as an audio engineer *cough cough Sony cough*.  They are fairly comfortable- I think I would rather have the traditional over-the-head band but you get used to these pretty quick.  These sound nice, full- the bass doesn't thump like a lot of people like but to my ears it's smooth.  And most important, you can listen for hours without ear fatigue.  Without a doubt, these are the best budget phones I've ever owned!  My bottom line- anyone who doesn't grab these for $10 bucks a pop is insane.  Period *g\n",

My office is between the shop, where we make rocket engines, and the flight line on the airport, where airplanes are tested. Sometimes jet aircraft sit outside my window and perform engine run-ups, or idle the APU for hours.

       "I've bought several of these cables and have been very happy with my purchase.  I've used them for hooking up my Gaming Systems, TV, Cable Box, and Receiver/DVD Player.  (Note: I had to buy a small 3 in 1 Fiber Optic Switch Box to handle all these cables -my Receiver and TV only had one digital audio connection each.)\n",
       "\n",
       "I believe that these cables are the best name brand VALUES currently around for Fiber Optic Audio.\n",
       "\n",
       "What do you REALLY get for a \"high end\" fiber optic cable that is triple the cost of this cable? I don't know.  I purchased one (which was \"top of the line\") and obscenely expensive, and of course it sounds great, but these cables sound great too.  Plus, these cables ARE Monster cables, AND they are THX certified!\n",
       "\n",
       "What does THX certification mean? Below is a blurb taken directly from the THX website describing it:\n",
       "---\n",
       "\"THX is on the forefront of entertainment technology, offering products and services of unparalleled quality for post-production, distribution and playback of audio and visual content. THX Certification is considered a mark of excellence in the presentation technology industry, offering consumers a promise that the cinemas they visit and the products they purchase have been evaluated and tested to meet the highest standards for picture and sound performance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "A digital signal is a digital signal.  This is fiber optic cable -it uses light to transmit the digital data -it doesn't degrade like analog based on the quality of the cable.  So these cables are NOT likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables, they just are going be a little less durable, and probably use slightly less high quality materials.  Are they fragile? Not at all, but the top of the line cable that I purchased was so thick that I probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine. This THX cable is thinner and I could imagine it breaking more easily.  If you work somewhere (like a studio) where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable.  (Same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly -i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends).\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, I'm very happy with these cables and can I afford to buy a bunch for all the fiber optic audio connections I am now using (i.e. Receiver, TV, Cable Box, Xbox/Playstation/Gamecube)\n",
       "\n",
       "(P.S. for first time users, don't forget to pull off the tiny plastic coverings on each end of the fiber optic cables.  These are there to protect the cable during transit/storage and will prevent the light from passing unless removed.  Throw these tips away; you'll never need them again.\n",

IT has all the things and want and many more, The hand sets are very clear and I love the fact I can check voice mail on any hand set that goes with it I do not have to run to the main answering machine to check the voice mail. The range of the hand sets is great had no problem at all with this.  So far I love everything with this phone, It is much better than either of the last two phone I have had. I have walked over a 1/2 block from the house and it still works clearly, I have never had a phone that worked so far away from home\n",

       "I purchased the Notebook Cooler approximately one month ago, after reading online testimonials of laptops becoming damaged from overheating. Thankfully, the same time I read that, Circuit City was having a sale on this item for only $15, after mail-in rebate. Fast forward one month and my opinion of the Cooler so far: not bad... \n",
       "\n",
       "My laptop is noticeably cooler to the touch now, and the internal fan rarely comes on. The Notebook Cooler itself is smartly designed, with an aluminum topping and two fans that draw away heat. I'll admit, the USB connector cable is a bit flimsy, and I can see why some folks have complained. For those users who travel frequently (or anyone who foresees plugging and unplugging the cable often), you may want to exercise extra caution. The blue LED light that some reviewer claims is too \"strong\" is a minor quibble--if you really wanted to, you could always tape over the light and problem solved. As for the fan noise, I would say the low setting is comparable to \"white noise,\" which you don't really notice until you purposely try to listen for it! The high setting, on the other hand, is a bit loud, and I can see people having to turn up the volume on their speakers or TV to compensate. Usually, though, I only use the high setting when it's really hot in the room, or if I'm running intensive programs like Photoshop or some video game. \n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, I'd say I'm very satisfied with this product. (Though, I am somewhat disappointed that Antec needs 3 months to process my $15 rebate check.) \n",

       "I bought two pairs of these when I saw them in a store on sale for under $15 each.  They've both gotten extensive use over the past couple years.  The cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that I suppose imitates leather in looks and feel.  This outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs, which makes it look raggedy, but the comfort and sound quality isn't affected by it so I don't consider it a big deal.   The headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it \"should,\" but likewise, it's something to be expected with this much use and hasn't affected comfort.\n",

It stays in place on the desk. The gel continues to be supportive, even after a year of working on it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the back of the wrist rest that lays on the desk has a horrible smell. I can't smell it while typing, only when I pick it up for cleaning. I wish there was the option for half stars - I'd give this 4-1/2 stars\n",

       "3.  Also, the answering machine has operated flawlessly so far.\n",
       "4.  The battery life of the cordless handset has been excellent between charges.  At least a week, sometimes more.\n",
       "5.  Voice quality of the cordless handset and the corded base handset are very good.\n",

The prints are 4800x1200dpi and look like real lab prints. I use the HP 4x6 boarderless Premium Plus photo paper with the HP Ink and the prints are just wonderful. Forget the other bad reviews because this printer beats them all. (...) The HP produces bright, vivid pictures designed to last a lifetime. The PictureMate is also alot larger than the HP 475. The 1.5GB hard drive is a plus as well. HP said that the remote is not included but they lied, they come with the remote and battery. Overall, this printer is the best I have own\n",

Well, there's no such thing on these DVDs.  The top looks a lot like the writing surface on the other side (other than the characteristic DVD color).  Anyone who has seen unbranded DVDs will know exactly what I'm talking about- No special surface; however  a felt tip marker works nicely to label the disks.  Huge cost cutting here I guess, but definitely not in the quality department.  I will buy again\n",

       "First off, these puppies sound good! However, there are things anyone intending to buy these earphones should know:\n",
       "\n",
       "The sound is loud and crisp but definetely mid-trebley, as with most in-ear headphones. The low end is there, but for full effect, it takes to position the earphones just so in your ear canal at the right volume. Since they tend to slide out of the ear canal as one moves, this sweet spot is not very wide. That said, however, I recognize the difficlulty of delivering earth shaking bass in a device this small. Most bass-rich systems utilize either massive speakers/ woofers or chambered enclosures (or both) to deliver. Since the size of this type of headphones doesn't permit for either big speakers or special chambers, maybe the thing to do is to use the human cranium as the resonating chamber! I am yet to find any in ear headphones that really deliver bass to die for. Such is the difficulty to get big bass in so compact a package. Maybe the 5 and 7 series are better in this regard (for the price they better be).  So if you really need earth shaking bass in your playback, look into buying those pricey phones.  The lack of such bass is the only reason \n",
       "i didn't give it five stars.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, the lack of colored LEFT (blue or white) &amp; RIGHT (red) tags on the earphones make it tricky to put on for the first time. I didn't realize I had them reversed until the pain got so unbearable I just had to check.  So be careful.\n",
       "\n",
       "Riding while using them can be dangerous, since the sound isolation is so great one can barely hear jets thundering overhead. \n",
       "\n",
       "Bang for the buck, ( I paid $69.99 on amazon), I really recommend these headphones to all but big bass aficionados.\n",

Picture quality is very good; I'm very used to my high-quality Sony DVD player DVP-NS700P, but this one is very close. There is just a touch of graininess to the picture from the Cable box, but then I've not compared with other units. I think its more than acceptable. A DVD I burned played fine on the Sony..but...when I recorded one program, deleted it, and then recorded again, it would only play on an older Sony DVD player. My Sony DVD player is kind of touchy, anyhow. \n",

       "I don't normally write reviews on products but in this case I feel I must share the value and features of this product.  You can't go wrong in selecting this player/recorder for your DVD needs.  The quick start guide is just that \"quick\" and well planned.  The people at Samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best I have seen well documented with pictures (in full color) and just that step-by-step for the novice.  The setup diagram is excellent.  The features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize (any disc) and away you go.  One touch record starts immediately.  The quality is superb especially in High Definition. I couldn't wait to get it after reading the reviews from the last Electronics Trade Show so I was able to get it from back East about three weeks ago. Finalizing discs is a snap and easy I have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the Samsung is so easy the on-screen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers! It will play mp3s, CDs, computer made DivX movies, Region 1 DVDs, Picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly.  You can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer's codes which they list in a handy guide.  If you are shopping for a multi recorder/player search no more get this one you won't be disappointed\n",

Mine is pink, and the color is so nice, the design sleek and seamless all around. It's smooth metal casing is really nice and different. The clickwheel is smooth and I have had no problems with it.\n",
       "\n",
       "It holds a little less than 1,000 songs due to different formatting, but it's still a good amount; iTunes is easily understandable and functional as well. The ipod mini is approx. 1/2 of an inch think and slides into pockets easily, while not being as flimsy as the nano feels to me. The clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs, raher than, as on my brother's mp3 player, needing to press \"next\" everytime you change the song. The backlight is fine, and does it's job; my one complaint on that would be that, as I mainly use it on the bus at 6:00 am, it is quite bright and hurts my eyes.\n",

I've actually invested waay more on accessorites for my mini than it cost itself, but that's how much I love it!\n",

       "I haven't written any reviews for Amazon before, but when prompted for my feedback on this trackball, I had to respond.  I've been using one of these or its predecessors since the early 90's when Kensington first came out with the \"Turbo Mouse\".  It was great then, and now it's better.  This is as solid, smooth, and precise of an input device as you can get.  I don't understand those others with buttons on the side that when you press them the trackball slides across your desk.  This baby stays right where you put it because your button presses go straight down.  You can use it with just the tips of your fingers or your whole hand -- your choice.  The optical version is far superior to the old mechanical ones that needed frequent cleaning to stay in tip top performance.  The only drawback is the $100 retail price, but frankly it's worth that.  It's a no brainer at $80 which is what I paid through Amazon to Tiger Direct.  If you need (or want) a high performance trackball that you'll be able to use with many computers to come, get this one\n",

       "2. Very comfortable\n",

       "4. Worry-free charging\n",
       "\n",

       "3. Turning them off could be annoying (requires precise timing)\n",
       "\n",
       "My experience: I've had two pairs of these for over a year and I like them very much. I enjoy great sound watching TV or listening to music while everybody is asleep. This is really great, I can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night. The sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the TV. You have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the TV (closet or the garage for example). The headphones are light and very comfortable. I tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far. So, overall wonderful product. However, there a few flaws to be aware of. Consider the following before buying. It might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel. Sometimes, turning the headphones ON results in poor reception if any at all. To correct this, you have to press the only button (power, search, and turn off) and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel. You might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying. Once you get good reception, everything is ok although you might get some interference (alien noises) when you turn your head or move around. The last problem is with the turn off button (again the only multifunction button). You need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit. That is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on. You think you turned it off but it is still on and if it's not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely. Well, I hope my description is helpful. \n",
       "\n",
       "Regardless of the flaws, I recommend the AW771. I use them every day and best of all I enjoy great sound when other people are asleep. \n",

       "I have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set (a Midiland 5.1 system) was thoroughly aged and falling apart I decided it was time to upgrade.  I wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd's.  I shopped around and came to the conclusion I would aim for the form factor speakers.  When considering this bose system, this MUST be taken into account.    \n",
       "\n",
       "First off, this system is expensive.  For just under 1000 dollars (doesn't 999 sound sooo much better than 1g?) you get 5 bi-directional midrange speakers, the subwoofer unit, and speaker cable.  At this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver, but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his/her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget.  Bose includes 3 colors (white, silver, black) and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit (a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not). \n",
       " \n",
       "What brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness.  For their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any sound-granted they are paired with a competent receiver.  Anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through, without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store.  \n",
       "\n",
       "Once I got the system home it was very easy to set up and install.  Bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong to-a very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system.  The only serious issue I have with this system ended up being with my receiver (an Onkyo) and not related at all with the speakers.  \n",
       "\n",
       "Since I do run this through my computer (presently a laptop) I had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver, but when that was all said and done, I was extremely please with the system.  With a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tag-its target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges.  \n",
       "\n",
       "My test soundtracks included:  Gladiator, Matrix (II or III), Snatch, and music tracks ranging from techno, rock, classical, and alternative.  Everything sounded great with enough low, high, and midrange response.  The second complaint I have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites.  I found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers weren't drowning out the voices.  That was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there.  \n",
       "\n",
       "All in all this speaker system is a great investment in my mind satisfying all of my needs (though draining my bank account) and providing me with great surround sound.\n",
       "\n",
       "Good:  Great range and volume of sound.  Easy set-up.  Well built speakers-aesthetically and physically.  No interference or feedback.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bad:  Subwoofer awkward, no dedicated center channel, pricey, no included receiver.\n",
       "\n",
       "For their size these speakers more than compete with any full-blown tower 5.1 system.  Here is one satisfied customer\n",

       "Just a quick note to say that it is a pity that people buy 'toys' before exploring what it is that they're buying.  I have seen people knock the SanDisk U3 drives, as well as U3 drive made by other companies.  Well the reality is that:\n",
       "\n",
       "a- The U3 software has a way of stopping the software's auto-boot.\n",
       "\n",
       "b- There is Uninstall software available at at SanDisk.com and at U3.com, and I'm guessing that those company's that offer U3 and have a web site probably have the 'Uninstaller' on their site.\n",
       "\n",
       "c- There is a great deal of U3 software available (free and pay-for-it) at U3.com.  I know that SanDisk has a software site, so do Verbatim &amp; Memorex.\n",
       "\n",
       "d- For those who want portable software but don't want U3 or don't have a U3 drive, go to http://portableapps.com.  Note: some of the software here is the same used by the U3 folks, without using the U3 LaunchPad.\n",
       "\n",
       "e- Quality of drives: remember that when you buy most of the electronics 'toys' available today, you are buying Chinese c*** (junk).  Both the manufacturing and Quality Control (QC) are garbage.  Unless you are paying serious change for something ($500+) you will get passable junk.  If you are expecting \"made in Japan quality\" your kidding yourself.  This is the reason you will see many Brand Name goods, also selling with No-Name labels (i.e Coby).  Same production line, different labels.  It is also one of the reason folks are impressed with Apple iPods.  Apple demands excellent QC, and the destruction of goods that don't meet the standard.  In exchange you are willing to pay a 20% premium for this level of QC.  Like everything in life, ya gets whats ya pay for.\n",
       "\n",
       "g- Since the beginning of Windows (v1.0, et al) there have always been buggy and uncooperative software programs, there will always be pain in the a** software.  One of the reasons XP has such a prominent 'roll-back' feature.  And also the reason many, if not MOST, power users run multiple machines.  Of course, these days we have to fill Billy G's pockets by having to buy multiple paks of XP.  Most of my power-user friends run at least three or four machines, each one with a different use.  It shouldn't be this way, but the reality is that for folk that use or explore a great deal of software, for many purposes (MP3's, scanning, Video, controlling radios, composing music, et al), one machine won't cut it because XP ain't as stable as folks think.  The more programs, and the more varied in type, the more instability is introduced into ANY Windows installation. Why do you think businesses run Win2000 or Win2003, because there are less software 'toys' that run under 2K, and the 'admin' can prevent you from loading a lot of software 'toys'.\n",
       "\n",
       "h- In the end, understand what you are buying before you buy so that you'll have better luck getting what you want, and you won't look so ignorant when you say something that anyone who has bothered to go to the web site(s) knows is dead wrong, or just plain stupid.\n",
       "\n",
       "i- When you truly understand the product, you'll be able to write TRULY useful reviews, and that what all readers want, useful information.\n",
       "\n",
       "To one and all, may your 'toys' keep you happy\n",

       "I purchased this answering machine with the intention of expanding the quantity of phones to cover the entire house. To start, I bought only one additional phone. I'll buy the rest later. So far I am very pleased. The sound quality is excellent and there are numerous bonus features that I have found very useful. Like the talking caller ID and being able to screen messages from any of the phones. I also like being able to program a phone directory into one phone and transfering (download) a single entry or the entire list to the other phones. And each phone is also a speaker phone and a full intercom.\n",
       "\n",
       "You can name the phones for the rooms they will occupy which will help when you use the intercom to call a specific room. So you would page the \"Living Rm\" rather than phone #3, etc.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you have caller ID, you can program special rings and special call ID colors for the callers in your phone directory but that information must be programmed into each phone. It doesn't transfer when you download the directory to the other phones. \n",
       "\n",
       "Also, on another Panasonic wireless phone that I own, the incoming call displayed the name I had programmed into the phone directory. Just like your cell phone will say \"home\", etc. On this phone, the caller ID displays the telephone company info only. \n",
       "\n",
       "I think the phone is great, I just wanted to clarify some points that are not crystal clear in the literature.\n",

       "I recently began upgrading my home audio by buying at Ebay 2 pairs of JBL E20s and 1 Pair E30s, an E25 center speaker and a Harmon Kardon AVR. I got the first pair of e20s a week ago and the 2nd pair of E20s and the E30 yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend. \n",
       "\n",
       "The E20s and E30s are listed as \"Bookshelf Speakers.\" The E20s ARE bookshelf speakers. As I wrote in my review of the E20s, the E30s can only be thought of as bookshelf speakers if you last name is Kong and your first name is King! The E20s are heavy at 7lbs each, not flimsy little boxes as some cheapo bookshelves are. The E30s are HEAVY. HEAVY! 16 lbs each. (That is what my 7 qt lodge cast iron dutch oven weighs!) They are 15 inches high and 12 inches deep. They need to be placed on small end tables or speaker stands 18 to 24 inches off the floor. \n",
       "\n",
       "I am very pleased with both the E20s and E30s. For small speakers, the E20s have some oomph and can be cranked up. The E30s have OOOMMPHHHH. They WANT to be cranked up. Yesterday I tried them out by listening to my mp3 files of the Animals Singles and Paul Revere and the Raiders Kicks. When cranked up, the E30s sound at least 1000% better than the the E20s.  I hooked them up to my vintage JVC AV receiver circa 1989 that has 80 watts front and 20 watts rear power. At a little over half volume my ears began to hurt. You can really feel the bass and the drums kick. \n",
       "\n",
       "I also listened to about 2 hours of The Doors via Rhapsody with the audio out from my computer to the audio in on my receiver. I have been listening to this music since it was first played on the airwaves back in the 60s. The E30s are simply incredible! They brought some very familiar tunes to life and made them new and fresh.\n",
       "\n",
       "My biggest surprise with the E30s is that they sound very good at lower volumes, not as good as the E20s, but still very good. As I write, I am watching/listening to a DVD of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons concertos performed by Herbert Von Karajan, the BPO and Anne-Sophie Mutter on fiddle and am running the E30s and E20s at about 15% volume--pretty low since the 4 speakers are sharing the front 80 watts of my receiver. Yet I can still HEAR everything at low volumes including the resonating violins and the harpsacord. Since we normally do not rock the house down all the time and we do often listen at lower levels, I am very pleased at how good they sound without having to blow out my eardrums. \n",
       "\n",
       "I bought the E30s for under $90 including s/h. Back in the early 80s or late 70s I spent more than four times this amount (adjusted for inflation) for 2 large, heavy Advent Loudspeakers with 8\" woofers. The E30s clearly sound better than I ever remember the Advents sounding including better bass response, and I liked the Advents! Over time, our audio choices have gotten better and cheaper. You still can spend mega bucks and buy a $10,000 McIntosh system (or even drop that much on a turntable magnetic cartridge as I saw at one website!) It all depends on what your budget is. The JBLs are a great value offering tremendous perfomance for those who are budget minded\n",

       "Noel Lee's Monster Cable products Inc., come up with the goods here! A cable of stunning, high resolution that snaps the picture into such clarity that you'll think you're watching scenes through a glass window and not through a television/monitor, a bold claim indeed, BUT, quite true never-the-less. I was totally unprepared for such a dramatic change for the better. This cable brings to the viewer ALL the picture, and, yes, that does mean \"Warts and all\"so, be prepared to see the smallest of detail, like strings and wire that enabled special effects crews to do their work \"Un-seen\". Who really needs HDTV when cables like Monster's MVS3-1M are this good and can bring a vastly superior standard to an existing television/monitor for only a minute fraction of the cost. Thanks Noel, well done\n",

IMO, you cannot beat the sound of a set of \"over-the-head\" headphones. I have tried all styles: earbuds, behind the neck, clips, even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus, you can't beat that price\n",

The greatest feature of this phone is it has a HOLD button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless, etc.  Also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen.

       "First off, let me say that this is a VERY impressive monitor.  My points of reference for that statement are my other three LCD monitors: three Samsung models, two of which are 913Ns and the other is a 712N.  These two Samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this ViewSonic, and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this ViewSonic.  Surprisingly, I actually can see the brightness difference between the Samsungs and this ViewSonic, but, for my taste and needs, the Samsungs are simply too bright, and I end up turning down their brightnesses anyway.  For high light, daytime use, I have found that I do like to have the brightness all the way up on the ViewSonic, but I truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being.\n",
       "\n",
       "Installation was simple: in fact, something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that, interestingly again, the drivers that are on the ViewSonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation CD, even though the driver package that is posted on the ViewSonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago.  When I first installed this monitor and turned it on, I truly do not think the picture was as clear, or the graphics as rich, as any of the Samsung monitors that I own.  But, and this is another tip for new users of this product, the default setting for the ViewSonic screen contrast was set MUCH lower than the maximum setting.  When I increased the contrast up to its maximum setting, I believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal, if not fully equal, to those on the other LCDs that I own.\n",
       "\n",
       "One big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a DVI cable included, so you save that added expense (this isn't true with all ViewSonics).  And, especially with the digital connection, I have no doubts about ViewSonic's claim that this monitor has nearly twice (5ms versus 8ms) the refresh rate as the Samsungs.  I have to admit that I wasn't sure I needed a widescreen display, but I believe it's going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones!  This is a really a fine monitor!\n",
       "\n",
       "Now for a few small negatives.  One reason I haven't purchased ViewSonics in the past is that they put a fairly tall bar on the bottom of these screens to accommodate speakers.  I already have a fine speaker system set up and connected to my computer, so I really have no use for monitor speakers.  Additionally, those ViewSonic speakers always raise the monitor height up much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Strains my neck.  The reason I really didn't worry about it on this monitor was because, while there are speakers, they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other ViewSonic monitors.  With that said, I have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than I had expected.  For example, on the 17 inch Samsung monitor, the bottom of the screen is 3 3/4\" from the desktop.  On the 19 inch Samsungs, it is 4 inches.  On this ViewSonic, the bottom of the screen is 5 1/2 inches above the desktop.  It's not bad, but it's going to take a bit of getting used to.  If all else fails, other monitor stands are available.\n",
       "\n",
       "As with most electronic products these days, there is very little in the way of documentation.  The 87 billion language installation card tells diddly.  The .PDF manual that is installed on the computer simply says the standard self-explanatory things.  However, I found the interactive help program on the manufacturer's website be quite useful in helping fix a few small problems, surprisingly.\n",
       "\n",
       "All in all, I'm very impressed so far, and I'm really looking forward to using this monitor!  By the by, shipping from Amazon.com was amazingly fast: it shipped the next day, and it arrived the day after that.  I can't complain about that speed!  My only question is why they would need a weight surcharge on this but could ship an extremely heavy wood lathe for free?  Go figure!  Anyway, a solid four stars for this monitor\n",

       "\n",
       "However, be sure to update the firmware or the AP might not work correctly.  When I first received it, configuration was easy enough but it had trouble working with my Netgear and HP Centrino notebook.  Both notebooks will get a signal and even connect be failed to obtain an IP address from my network's DNS server.  A firmware upgrade solved the problem and the AP now streams TV realibly from my living room to the kitchen.\n",

That features works well, there's a slightly longer pause as it connects through to the cell phone but that's trivial.  I will say this, you need to keep your cell phone within about 20' of this base.  I just take mine off, turn on Bluetooth and it automagically pairs up with the base.\n",

       "Researched a lot before I bought this TV and for the money, this one was hands down the best 32\" LCD.   Also, Amazon had the best price by far and it shipped to my house in a timely manner with no major issues.   \n",
       "I mainly use this TV for my XBOX 360.  You will NOT be disappointed if you are planning on doing the same.   The game mode does enhance the picture a great deal as well.  I provides sort of an Anti Aliasing effect smoothing out some of the rough edges. All in all, after owning the tv for about 2 months now, I couldn't be happier.   To get around the poor speakers, I just plug in a nice set of headphones and games sound GREAT.  \n",
       "I've also hooked up an HD antenna and regular cable.  HD channels have a very good picture over the air.  Some football games almost look better on this than on my 42\" Samsung DLP downstairs with the HD Cable.  There's also a nice Antenna button on the remote which quickly swaps between cable and the Over the Air Antenna.  \n",
       "The only drawbacks to the TV are the 1 component input and the fact you can't use the PIP with the cable connected, only the antenna.  \n",

       "I had a Zen Vision:M but I returned it because I decided I didn't need quite that much storage capacity and the hard drive seemed to sputter and whirr too often and I wanted the peace of mind that comes with owning a flash player compared to a hard drive player, so I decided to go with the Zen V since it's interface is almost identical to that of the Zen Vision M's(which I liked).\n",
       "\n",
       "The first thing you will notice is the physical design.  Initially I wasn't that impressed, but it's really grown on me.  The height x width dimensions are comparitively much much smaller than the iPod nano.  You can actually wrap your entire hand around the device, and the soft finish feels very nice in your hand.  The second color that fills the seams of the player is a very nice touch as well.\n",
       "\n",
       "The music is organized your standard Artist-Album-Song interface that is becoming quite a bit stale in my opinion. Still, it's as simple as you can get I suppose.  The device officially supports album art although it seems to be very hit-or-miss in that regard in my experience. The screen is vibrant and colorful but is very hard to see in bright sunlight.\n",
       "\n",
       " The middle joystick is used for navigation and it works very well in that regard, although wedging your thumb underneath to move upward can be tricky sometimes and result in an accidental button push.  A dedicated volume control switch is found on the side and a hold switch on top.  \n",
       "\n",
       "The player syncs with WMP11 via USB connection.  Syncing it is a snap although I was not impressed with the transfer speeds. Also, if you sync the tracks on your player back to another computer, album art will not be attached to the music tracks.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you are a newbie to buying MP3 players make note of the different sized models.  The 2GB model for instance advertises that it holds 1000 songs but these figures are theoretical maximums based on low quality files.  Most of my files are mid bit-rate WMAs and I can fit about 500 songs on the player, half as much as advertised.  \n",

       "Pros:\n",
       "Excellent physical design\n",

       "For reference, I've owned a set of Labtec APX-6420 2.1 speakers for about 6-7 years now. With the purchase of a a new computer (Mac Pro + Cinema Display) I decided it was also time to upgrade my speakers. I spent a very long time mulling over different brands and models, listening to them in stores whenever possible. Of the major \"PC speaker\" makers, I recall sampling Altec Lansing, Logitech, Klipsch, Bose, Creative, and JBL. Aside from listening in stores (a poor environment) I also took into account personal experience with the brands (mostly the first three I listed) in regular \"home\" situations.\n",
       "\n",
       "I initially wanted the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1's because of the fantastic reviews they've gotten on Amazon and elsewhere, but was turned off to them because of the apparently poor build quality (parts breaking very quickly), along with reports of buzzing, the power switch being on the back of the subwoofer, my impression of them in stores, and experience with a friend's ProMedia 4.1's (which neither I nor him really cared for, and which recently broke).\n",
       "\n",
       "I tried as many Logitech speakers as I could in many different situations and  decided I HATE ALL OF THEM (with the sole exception of the Z-5500's which I own and love)! The bass especially sucks on their speakers.\n",
       "\n",
       "So... through all this I eventually came to the conclusion that Altec Langsing was the brand I wanted to go with. And if that was so, it had to be the FX6021's which I had been eyeing for years. The first time I heard them in a store I declared them my favorite of the selection at the time and the same is still true. These are probably the best sub-$200 2.1 PC speakers you can buy. Even at their MSRP of $250 they're probably worth it. These speakers a very nice!\n",
       "\n",
       "The sound is very clear and sharp. Get ready to hear all the distortion in your low bitrate digital audio files. The speakers especially shine when listen to live recordings or anything that was produced by real instruments (i.e. not techno, though that sounds good too).\n",
       "\n",
       "Subwoofer is NOT \"boomy\" or \"buzzy\" like others have reported. I never use the equalizer in iTunes and have the bass at about half. It's very deep, rich, and discrete. Doesn't shake the floor or cause my neighbors to complain--yes, I live in an apartment too and bass is a concern of mine. For those who complain about the bass: maybe you shouldn't have gotten 2.1 speakers? Maybe your units were defective? Or perhaps the subwoofer was placed in a very poor position? I know sound is highly subjective, but those reviews just don't sound right to me.\n",
       "\n",
       "PROs:\n",
       "* Tall, sleek, and sexy satellites provide a nice wall of sound and match the Cinema Display perfectly.\n",
       "* Bass and treble have a *large* range of adjustability. 50% of either is plenty enough for me.\n",
       "* Power button on control pod\n",
       "* This is important: NO BUZZING. Not while they're on, not while they off. 100% silent.\n",
       "\n",
       "CONs:\n",
       "* Volume adjustment is digital and moves in \"notches\"; these notches aren't always small enough. I much prefer a regular analog knob.\n",
       "* Remote is a bit useless\n",
       "* While they look good and perform well, they feel a little cheap\n",
       "* Get ready for lots of cables hanging from your desk and all over the floor (on the other hand, long cables are a PRO as well)\n",
       "\n",
       "And finally, don't be fooled by specs. Yes, other speakers may have more watts of power and THX certification, but that really doesn't matter as much as it might seem. These are more than loud enough for any sane person (100% volume would probably wake up the neighborhood). I really didn't pay any attention to the specs, I bought them because they sound the best\n",

       "I've owned these Altec's for over three years now, and I have yet to ever coming close to replacing them - as a matter of fact, when facing the decision of buying another set of speakers for a new computer, I went ahead and still purchased these babies!\n",
       "\n",
       "SOUND QUALITY --- the sound quality is very crisp and excellent overall - I have used mine for video editing, and I'm very pleased with how clear the dialogue audio has come through, in addition to the special effects sound - unless you need a five speaker system (or comparable) then I'm confident that this is the most crisp sound you'll find in any speaker\n",

       "\n",
       "COMPATIBILITY --- This is the part I love most - there is no software to install and no special plugs - the speakers plug right in, and very easily, into the audio jack, just like a pair of headphones would --- thus, hooking in a computer, iPod, cd-player, etc, is easy as heck, making these speakers extremely universal for any sound equipment\n",
       "\n",
       "CONTROLS --- the speaker system comes with a seperate remote, giving one access to adjust the volume, bass, and treble, all seperately from the computer's controls -- the knob to control the volume, and other functions, is easy to use and makes for quick adjustments\n",
       "\n",
       "SIZE --- the speakers are extremely thin and the subwoofer is a very manageable size -- placing these speakers is easy\n",

       "My sound improvement wasn't as dramatic as many people describe, likely because I already had my computer wired to a good reciever and speakers, but I did notice an improvement over the integrated system I have once I made some adjustments. If you listen to rock, pop, blues or jazz, this card can make everything seem a bit brighter and punchier. It also seems to improve Pandora internet radio streams even more than my mp3's, though I have to keep the volume at about 3/4 in the Pandora player to prevent distortion. If you mostly listen to classical on a good stereo, I'm not sure if this card will do much for the sound, but it might\n",

       "I wondered what kind of mouse I would get for $60.  I kept thinking, what could be so special about it.  Well, I don't know where to begin.  I like it so much, I'm getting ready to purchase another one just to use at work.  I used a Microsoft Explorer mouse prior and thought I'd never find a mouse that was as comforable to use and had all the extra buttons I needed.  This mouse completely puts the Explorer to shame.  It took me a few minutes to get used to how quickly it responds but I soon caught on.  I really didn't care for the glowing or the chameleon paint on it.  That's not why I got it, although it does look pretty cool.  As for gaming, I really didn't notice much improvment in my skill but it REALLY does feel better in your hand.  The bottom of the mouse it curved in so you can grip it much easier.\n",

       "I decided to upgrade my laptop with the wpc54gs from the wpc54g.  I did this because the \"g\" card would randomly disconnect when the WEP or WPA security was activated.  Living in a home near about 6 other networks I really wanted the router and wireless network secured.  So, I purchased this card to see if it would fix my problem.  I can happily say it solved the random disconnect with WPA security turned on.  The range is just fine and all my network connections seem solid.  Have not had a disconnect yet, over the last 5 hours.\n",

Though not stellar audiophile quality, the sound is pretty darn good, and with some minor EQ it's excellent. The noise cancelling effect seems to work very well: much better than I expected. Furthermore, the headphones are very comfortable and seem to be solidly constructed. I highly recommend them\n",

       "I recently bought a new 6.0 megapixel digital camera (Canon PowerShot S3 IS) which came with an extremely small and  practically useless 16MB secure digital card so I bought a couple of these 1GB PNY PSD1GRF3 secure digital cards since they were on sale for less than $20 apiece.  These SD cards are made in Japan by Toshiba (they are then rebranded and sold by PNY, Lexar, DaneElec, etc.) and I have been very pleased with them so far.  They work flawlessly with no write-speed delay in my new camera while shooting still pictures or while shooting video with stereo sound, and the card reader in my HP Pavilion M7480N Media Center PC (running Windows XP Professional service pack 2) reads the pictures and video into my Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 and Premiere Elements 2.0 software programs with no problems.  The only drawback is that the read-speed on these standard SD cards is a bit slow when compared to the newer and faster SD cards...it takes several minutes to transfer all the pictures or video from a full 1GB card onto my PC...but I find this to be a small inconvenience rather than a big problem.  So, if a little longer read time is not a problem for you, then save yourself some money and buy this card.  Overall, a very good standard SD card at an excellent price!     \n",

I would recommend you leave the lights on though because if you don't you will be getting just a black, fuzzy dark image back if you are using this camera for security. This camera is a very simple easy to use camera without the fuss of zooming, pan, tilt etc. If you need a simple camera you can't go wrong with the D-link DCS-900 (Wireless or wired version)\n",

       "I bought this package purely for the keyboard. I wanted a new one with wireless technology and I was driven to Bluetooth just because it is so reliable. I do not use the keyboard and mouse together, however.\n",
       "\n",
       "The keyboard is one of the most comfortable keyboards I've ever used. I am a computer programmer so having a nice keyboard is essential. The pad at the bottom is very comfortable and the keys are very well spaced and organized. The only real compliant is they cut some corners with the home, end, page up, page down, and delete keys. They moved them around from the conventional way which I still haven't gotten used to but it's fine.\n",
       "\n",
       "I have experience no lag with either the mouse or the keyboard. I play a game called StepMania (a sort of Dance Dance Revolution clone for PC) which requires very accurate timing with the keyboard. I've experienced no problems here, it's spot on and probably the fastest ever. The only problem, really, is it takes a while to register if you haven't use the keyboard for a while since it must turn back on from sleep mode and reconnect. After that however, there are no problems at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "I do not use the mouse with the keyboard. I decided to use it as a mouse with my iBook since it had built-in bluetooth. I had absolutely no problems connecting the two devices and it works flawlessly. I don't use the mouse very much, but the times I do use it I experience no problems.\n",
       "\n",
       "Both the range on the mouse and the keyboard are extremely nice. I can go anywhere in my room with either the mouse or keyboard and experience no problems.\n",
       "\n",
       "The battery life on the keyboard is also very nice, esspecially since it has the built-in sleep feature. I have had to replace the batteries once since I got the unit in January of 06 (currently June of 06). I have not had to replace the mouse batteries yet, but I do not use it very much.\n",
       "\n",
       "Others complained about not being able to use the keyboard in the BIOS or startup screens, but I haven't had any issues with that. It depends on how recent your motherboard is, and mine is relatively new so I had no problems.\n",
       "\n",
       "I highly recommend this setup to anyone wanting a wireless keyboard or mouse, or if you want to split and use the mouse with a laptop and keyboard with a desktop. Either way, you cannot go wrong with this package, it is extremely excellent\n",

As stated by another reviewer a set of batteries only lasts a few months, even if you do not use the battery-powered speaker phone often.  This phone would be a great phone (for the price) if it did not use batteries, but was a plug-in model\n",

       "I purchased this phone system as a gift. I set it up and used it extensively. The handsets have features that you are used to finding in a cell phone. Many different ring tones to choose from, the antenna lights up when a call comes in. You can even set special colors and ring tones for specific callers so you'll know when they're calling without picking up the handset.\n",

This will basically be constantly charging the batteries and will wear them out MUCH faster. Instead leave the phone off the charger until the battery alert beeps and the phone displays \"recharge\" on the screen. Then let it get a full charge. You'll find that the batteries will not need to be replaced for a year or more instead of 6 months or so\n",

       "I was looking for a new pair of headphones to compliment my brand new ipod nano when I ran across these on a website. I was a little hesitant at first because I don't think I ever spent over $40 on a pair of headphones. I finally decided to invest in these because I spend most of my free time listening to music. I received these the other day, and immediately plugged them into my ipod. Please don't let the breaking in period discourage you! After these become comfortable, you will hear music you have never heard before even when you are listening to songs you have heard thousands of time.\n",

       "I started with all my heavy bass tracks, and couldn't believe how they sounded with these headphones. I then wanted to try some of my jazz and blues tracks to see how these tracks sounded. This is the first time in my life John Coltrane has given me goosebumps!\n",

If you are just a casual music listener, I would say just go with a good pair of cheap ones, you will save a lot of money. However if you are a passionate music lover and collector, these headphones will change your music completely. After getting comfortable with these, I would have paid much more than I actually did\n",

       "This is the Ultimate Ears Super fi model especially designed for \"bassheads,\" featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies. I don't think UE would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature. Yes, the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed, but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the bright side, however, the bass reproduction is  marvelous. Not only is the quantity/extent of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones I've ever used, the quality is excellent. The bass is tight and pleasant, neither boomy nor thumpy. This overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the UE 5 EB's ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented \"front and center,\" including techno bass (aka \"car audio bass\"), drum n' bass, and many types of rap/hip-hop. For music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall, opinions will vary. With rock music, for example, the strong bass is certainly a plus, but I have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly, and some detail is lost.\n",
       "\n",
       "It should be noted that this bass-dominated sound signature renders the EB's a good choice for people who own iPods and feel that their music player is weak on bass. Without any EQ adjustment, the iPod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is PRESENT. \n",
       "\n",
       "In terms of build, the EB's superficially seem well-constructed and designed. I have heard complaints, however, that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage. Be careful out there! Thoughtfully, EB has includes a variety of ear tips with these IEM's (including foam, flanged, and plain) so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit. The EB's don't extend deeply into the ear canal, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal, comfort is good and isolation decent. However, if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating. Making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the EB's.\n",
       "\n",
       "Oh, and some people think that the EB's look kind of strange when worn. Larger than the higher-priced Super fi 5 Pro model, the EB's stick out a bit. Your call as to whether this is a problem.\n",
       "\n",
       "Like all of the UE IEM's in this series, the EB's are packaged with a nice set of accessories, including a 1/4\" adapter plug, a sound attenuator, a soft travel case, an earwax loop, and a silvery metal storage case which includes a winder that helps head off what is always a problem with IEM's, cord tangling.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's unlikely that the EB's will prove satisfactory as your \"everyday\" earphone unless you listen solely to bass-dominant types of music. The truth is, however, that even for bass-heavy music the overall sound signature of the Super fi 5 Pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users (I own both). But as a second pair specifically for use with bass-y music, the EB's are well-designed and definitely fun\n",

       "I love this controller.  I've had it for two days and have had nothing but excellent results.  I've only used it in NFS games (I have them all).\n",

       "The WiFi works flawlessly and I have a WiFi network in my house.  Installation is simple and takes maybe 3mins.\n",

       "I like the weight of the controller.  It's not feather light, so with that motor and battery weight added, it feels more like a premium device (just like the 67$ with tax I paid for it - canadian dollars).  I didn't like how my gravis gamepad as so light, so this is a step up.\n",
       "\n",
       "The analog sticks are a great for racing as they are progressive like a steering wheel.  They are rubber gripped for non-slip action.  I am used to the D-Pad, so I have mine setup in NFS to use both as a directional control without having to press the MODE button to switch because you don't have time during a race to press a button before switching.\n",

       "I work at a home office so I am on the phone lot.  I always buy cordless phones I can use with a headset so I can have both arms free while I talk with a min of background noise intrusion. In other words, I don't talk with the phone cradled between my shoulder and ear. And I don't use speaker phone features. Let's just get that out of the way now since those are things some have complained about that I couldn't care less about.\n",
       "\n",
       "This phone first of all looks good and FEELS good. It was built with high quality plastics and metals on all surfaces. It has a nice solid weight to itself. Nothing tacky or cheap about it. It looks far better in person than it ever did in pictures. And it looks pretty good in pictures. I like how the bases are designed such that the antennas serve a double purpose as cradle supports for when the phone is docked. Clever design. The charging base light and back-lit buttons all look very slick.\n",
       "\n",
       "The screen is attractive. A big step up from back-lit LCDs or no screen at all like my previous phone.\n",
       "\n",
       "I like that you can very quickly find and hit Mute, adjust volume, and page through your caller history.\n",
       "\n",
       "The belt clip goes deep so the phone stays snugly attached to you pocket when you are walking around.\n",
       "\n",
       "I know many 5.8 GHz phones don't mention that only one direction of communication is at that frequency vs. both directions (as 2.4 GHz sometimes gets used too). I don't know for sure if this phone falls into that category, but I was in the market for a 5.8 GHz phone to avoid interference with my WiFi networks as well as to avoid microwave oven interference with my calls.  One thing's for sure: this phone definitely is immune from MY microwave oven. In the past when I was on a call heating up my coffee, static and voice quality went way down unless I got far away from the oven. With this new phone I can stand right by it while on High w/o ANY impact on voice quality.\n",
       "\n",
       "One other very cool feature is the spare battery charger. While it's nice that the battery can replace a unit that runs down in a handset right away, the best part is if you have a power failure. Your phone will keep truckin' and there is never a need to replace that battery with some short lived 9volt waste of time.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, I like how the phone by a bedside basically doubles as a digital clock. The phone base unit picks up the current time from the caller ID info provided by the phone company and uses that info to automatically set and broadcast the current time to all headsets and base station. No need to manually set the clock. And when not in use, sitting it is dock, the phone's screen displays the time.\n",
       "\n",
       "So far I've found the voice quality to be best of any cordless phone I've owned\n",

IMO, you cannot beat the sound of a set of \"over-the-head\" headphones. I have tried all styles: earbuds, behind the neck, clips, even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus, you can't beat that price\n",

       "With so many of these ipod speaker docks on the market, it was sort of struggle to decide.  Ultimately, I felt very comfortable going with the Bose brand.  Plus, in my opinion, this is about the sleakest and best-looking unit out there (I went with black; I'm not an Apple-white drone).  The sound is very, very good for small to medium size spaces.  There are not a lot of features to the unit, which I think is a good thing - it just focuses on the sound and the small footprint.  Mini remote control work well and again the small size makes it unimposing in this world of too many remotes.  Power cord is plenty long and I like the fact I can easily move the thing to a different room if I need music there\n",

The bose quality is very obvious, and it looks like you could spend 300 dollars on it, which brings me to my next point. ITS TOO EXPENSIVE. my recomendation is to buy an FM transmitter and listend to your ipod on any Fm raido.  The only disadvantage of an Fm transmitter to this is that this will charge your ipod, and its slightly easier(but thats what iPod is all about, isnt it...?)\n",

       "I was devout in my belief that I could get similar photo output from my Canon S800 with less expensive paper.  I bought those big boxes of 100 sheets of Kodak's photo quality glossy from Costco.  My prints were blotchy.  Then I got my hands on some of Canon's Photo Paper Pro, and my pictures were magically crystal clear.  The difference is amazing.  I never would've thought paper would make this much difference.  I've since bought Canon's 15 sheet packs multiple times.  I now use the Kodak stuff for drafts or to give prints to people who don't care much about the quality of the output, while I save the Canon Photo Paper Pro for prints we want to frame\n",

I don't know what people expect of these little speakers, but it is difficult to imagine them delivering as much bass as they do.  These are amazing little speakers that have accompanied me in all of my travels; from Paris to camping in Northern California.  I cannot imagine going everywhere without them.  They are not  equivalent to a $10k stereo system, but they are not meant to be.  All I need is my Zen touch or Zen micro and these speakers.  Do not listen to the other reviews, these speakers will make a decent stereo of your MP3 player.  Enjoy them anywhere\n",

       "Although I could go on and on about how Skype has changed my life forever, I will try to address the issue at hand, and that is the Polycom Communicator.  Basically I love the concept of the Polycom Communicator!  When I first started using Skype I used a USB headset that works great.  The problem is that it is a serious PITA to put the thing on when someone calls because I have to either a. Try to untangle the cord before accepting the skype connection, or b. answer the skype connection then try to untangle the cord.  If I chose option a. envariably I would miss half the calls, if I chose option b. everyone would always comment that I sounded so desheveled when I tried to answer the call.  Well, now with the new Polycom communicator all I have to do is answer the call.\n",
       "\n",
       "As far as the quality and performance of the Polycom communicator...that is the only reason I didn't give the item 4 stars.  It seems ocasionally that when you are in large conference calls that the Polycom communicator will cause feedback to other peoples lines.  It is really sporadic though, and I can't seem to reproduce it consistently.  Also, the driver for the Polycom Communicator has crashed on me a couple of times.\n",
       "\n",
       "So despite the downfalls that I mentioned above, there is no way I could give up my Polycom Communicator now.  I simply love it, I just wish those other issues never happened\n",

When I got it, I was sceptical; it looked to small, but I was wrong; the dimensions are perfect. And there is more than enough padding to protect the GPS from harm, yet it is small enough to stick in a jacket pocket, which I sometimes have to (late day meetings where I leave my backpack at work).

I wash them down each year and they are like new. The fans I have now are on their third barn year. In a normal house I'm sure they would last forever. They are a little noisy, but the horses don't care\n",

       "I purchased this dashmount so I could swap the GPS between vehicles without having to install a permanent mount.  I don't know what the \"feet\" of the base is made of, but it is basically like a rubber version of a lead blanket - it is heavy yet is very pliable.  This is useful since my dash (a 2004 F-250) has an uneven surface.  I can press and mold the feet to put the base in a certain position and under most circumstances it'll stay there.  Occasionally, on long or \"bouncy\" trips, it'll creep out of position a couple inches and I'll have to move it back.  I've seen some comments complaining of that - but I don't see it as a problem since common sense says it won't stay perfectly still since it isn't bolted in place.  Overall this mount has worked very well.\n",

       "My wife is going on a business trip next week and will be borrowing the GPS - I don't recommend she take the mount though - since the thing must way at least a couple pounds - too bulky and heavy to put in a suit case in my opinion\n",

       "I got the dash mount because a friend recommended it.  I thought the windshield mount worked fine except it was difficult to remove from the windshield.  I felt like I should remove it each time I parked somewhere.  Also, there was a fair amount of vibration since it usually was dangling. The dash mount is very heavy and flexible enough to \"mold\" to fit the surface of the dash.  However, it kept slipping off the surface of my Toyota Avalon until I found a little sticky pad to put it on.  That solved that problem.  Anyway, it is very easy to move it to the floorboard and cover it up when I stop, thus effectively hiding it from the temtation of a robber\n",

       "We bought this drum set for our 2 year old who is obsessed with the concept of drumming &amp; marching.  This is a first class set and as noted is almost too nice.  This is a huge step above the tupperware and pan lids our little guy used to use for his personal parades.  The drum is a bit heavy,large, cumbersonme for a two year old and of course is LOUD.  The cymbals are also loud but do have a professional sound quality. Do recommend this purchase. It does come a bit steep at $30 but is a very nice looking and performing set.  If you little one gets hooked on drumming via the pots and pans, spoil him/her with this first-class set that they should be able to use well into their childhood\n",

       "I bought this paper after my mom gave me a box of Epson 8.5x11 paper she didn't need.  I was really impressed by the quality of the pictures rendered on that paper by my printer.  When the paper ran out I looked for an economical replacement and found the price of most photo papers to be prohibitive - on the order of 40 cents per page.  Since you can only get 2 4x6 pics from a letter-sized sheet of paper, that comes to about 20 cents per print, not counting the cost of ink.  Finally I stumbled upon this paper - Epson S041727 - and the price per print was around 12 cents, which rivals the cheapest Internet photo printing services I've found.\n",

Satellite aquisition under the trees did not happen the few times I tried.  The display is excellent under sunny conditions.  Downloading waypoint data into a text file was simple.  I haven't used it yet under driving conditions, so I can't speak to using related features.  Were it damaged or stolen, I'd buy another one without hesitation\n",

       "There are so many times where the actual ink, can be the difference between a good copy, and a not-so-good copy on paper. With HP black ink cartridge #21, it is very convient, and easy to setup into your HP deskjet 3930 series printer. This cartridge is very inexpensive, and affordable for HP printers. I think of it as a must for your HP printers. While there are cartridges that are difficult to open, and install into your printers, this one installs in a snap. I really recommend this for my new HP printer, and so will you if you own a HP printer for this ink as well.\n",

       "Let's just say I am 39 and holding and have wanted an MP3 for years. My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4GB Nano. It is easy to use, but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD's, the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow. The sound quality is good. I like that it is small and lightweight. The screen is bright and easy to read...even with not so young eyes. I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader. I didn't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen...just tunes. I'm sure 1000 songs will hold me. \n",

       "I had been storing my music on a 2GB card in my palm pilot. I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sanso. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them. \n",
       "I got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down! I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item. This thing is great! I was up till 3AM listening to my music. The sound quality is so much better than I had expected! \n",
       "I really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac- Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano. The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top, so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection. \n",
       "I also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack. It works great! I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock). I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs. \n",
       "People are talking about this unit not having a radio on it, but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio, all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way, I already have all the songs I like at my fingertips!\n",
       "I think these headphones really make this nano great! I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play! For something so tiny, it rocks! I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sanso. This new nano is a must have!\n",

One  last note, twords the end of the cartrige life, a small line appears in the  content of my page letting me know its allmost time for a new one. simply  shake the cartrige, reorder, and by the time the new one arrives, the old  one is finished\n",

Configuring from one a/c type throttle to another is easy with the downloadable manager from CH prod. Compared to the GoFlight modular system this is great value. Unless $$ is no object and you're not interested in building a home cockpit, the CH line of av-sim controls is well suited to the aspiring and advaced flt. simmer\n",

I was re-booting it every few minutes under moderate usage, because it keep dropping my DSL connection or completely locking up. I just replaced it with a DGL-4300 based on all the positive reviews, and have been very happy so far. I don't need or use any of the advanced features for gaming; but already I've been very impressed with the DGL-4300 since it hasn't dropped any connections since I bought it last week.

Considering the price of it i just couldn't see it holding up for what i wanted to do. to my surprise this mic exceeded my expectations. For recording vocals this mic is amazing. a real professional sound for a extremely low price. i definitely recommend this mic to anyone out there looking for an in expensive way to make professional sounding material\n",

       "I have some decent mics in my cabinet, as well as a nice preamp, A/D converter and fire wire interface for my home multitracking setup.  I wasn't expecting as good or better quality than I can already get, but I hoped the Samson C01B USB Studio Condenser would at least give me a decent sound.  The idea was to have freedom and portablility that my studio set up prohibits.  I was not disappointed.  Installation was no more complicated that plugging the cable into a USB port on my laptop running XP and the other end into the mic.  It is far from the best mic I have, but it is certainly not the worst.  I have read reviews that say the recording quality is too thin, but I found that not to be the case.  The noise floor when recording with the Samson is a little high, and it is lacking in headroom compared to any traditional mic through my Millenia preamp.   I have to record at slightly lower levels than I am used to, but for $79, I am not complaining.  There is no significant latency recording 16 bits at 44100hz in Fasoft N-Track Studio.  The ability to plug this thing in and record at a whim is quite liberating.  Way to go, Samson\n",

       "The 6500B was the last one I tried of three.  I've had cordless Panasonic phones break too often in the past so was reluctant to buy one again.  But the other choices had major drawbacks.  I really needed a two-line phone that wasn't 2.4Ghz.\n",
       "\n",
       "The first I tried was the Uniden TRU8866.  It had a bad echo on the extra handset and other people complained about that too.  This phone uses phone company voice mail (no built-in ans mach) - which is fine - but I had the VM system go bonkers so lost all trust in it.  For over a week messages accumulated but we got no stutter-tone so didn't know there were any new messages - arrgghh.  Not the phones fault I know but it required VM for messaging so nope. \n",
       "\n",
       "Next I tried the new Motorola MD7081.  I really wanted to like this phone. It's a 2-line 5.8Ghz ans machine like the Panasonic 6500B.  I liked it's simplicity and easy switching between line 1 and 2.  Had battery backup for use during power outages and the best voice quality of the three.  But, it's answering system has no message counter.  That alone is no big deal but it didn't have any indicator to say whether you had any saved messages.  When a new message arrived it blinked and such - all good.  But, if I got home, say, and listened to a message for my wife, the blinking stopped and no indication of \"1 saved message\" or anything.  So, I would have to write a note to her to check the messages.  We're so used to relying on seeing a message counter and just listening to them if it's not zero that we thought this would become a nuisance.  I also would have liked an auto-line-selection so it would automatically answer the ringing line or select a non-busy outgoing line.  But, that would have messed up their simpler style button function - hmmm.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Panasonic, I am surprised to say, ended up being my favorite.  Hopefully it will be reliable.  I was always bothered by Panasonic's phones losing the date/time with any little power outage.  Happily, this phone sets its date/time from caller-id info even though the manual implies it wouldn't work quite that way.  With the right settings and phone company options (busy-forward), it elegantly supports two lines as if they are one.  I really like not thinking about which line is what - just pick up and talk.\n",
       "\n",
       "The 6500B has good voice quality and reasonable range.  It's much lighter than earlier caller-id handsets which I like.  I also like their shape of handset the best.  My gripes are the limit of 4 handsets - I would like 6 or 7.  Also, can't name the handsets so with intercom you have to remember each number\n",

       "This isn't my first mp3 player. I have a couple of the years and since my last one died I was looking for a quick, cheap replacement. I also needed a flash drive for work. Don't underestimate this, if you use the net at a library or cafe then you'll realize that 1. not all players/drives are recognized as drives and/or 2. you've got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port, which gets annoying quickly. when you clean out your purse and discover you don't have it with you. With this you get both in one. It has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems, even win98. The sound quality is good, I can't tell the difference between this and my $100.00 player. The controls do take a few seconds to get used to, but once I did I find I preferred them. They are easy to use one-handed.\n",
       "\n",
       "An unexpected bonus is that its great for audiobooks! If you turn off the player, it starts back up exactly where you left it, be it in the middle of a song or in the middle of a chapter! Its small without being too tiny, its design is simple enough that there is nothing to fall off or get lost and technophobes won't have a heart-attack. Its doesn't hold a lot of music at only 128mb or have a shuffle feature, but if you need to carry more than an album or 2, or need extra features then you'll want more than this player anyway. \n",
       "\n",
       "The best feature is the price. I found this one at my local ToysRUs for $15.00. It also plays both mp3's and wma. It won't play AAC but if most of your music is this format you'll better off with an ipod.\n",
       "\n",
       "This would make a good first player for a kid or for someone who needs a usb drive and music without all the bells and whistles. \n",

Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  \n",

       "The SanDisk SDSDB-128-A10 Secure Digital 128MB, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.\n",

       "If you buy this service plan, print out the contract (found at the top of this page) and keep your receipt. I did not purchase the plan, but looked over the contract intensely since I nearly got it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some notes on the contract:\n",
       "1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\n",
       "2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\n",
       "3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\n",
       "4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\n",
       "5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\n",
       "6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN'T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don't hold me liable since I don't have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.\n",
       "\n",
       "Assuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn't get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)\n",

Software allows for extra button assignment, but could use some work.  I have had some trouble finding the menus I want when I want to find them.  For example, I have an issue where I cannot find the extra button assignment menu after plugging in the USB receiver after a system start-up, however I am able to find those menus in the software if I remove and reinsert the receiver.\n",

       "The V200 is another great Logitech product. It is far from the king of the mouse, but when it comes to the notebook it doesn't get much better than this. It takes two AA batteries (so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots. The mouse doesn't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves. This is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel. With the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do. Overall the design is good. There could be a problem installing setpoint. It may hang on install. If so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again. It should work. The USB receiver is 2.4 GHz and has a 10 Meter range. Wow. However there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook. USB dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off. For this reason you should have the USB receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand, if you can, to avoid accidental contact. It should also not be hanging over the edge of the table. If you press it down lightly, then that is it, game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 GHz receiver. So okay you will have to spend on a new receiver, if you break the old one. The receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet. When it is in the holder the mouse turns off. It doesn't fit in smoothly. It creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse. Anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in. The other thing is that it can pop out sometimes. Just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way. I am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices. If you are then a mouse like this and USB should last for a very long time. There is really nothing wrong with it. Wireless mini mouse. FAB! However there is one last thing to say. If you don't like the idea of a USB receiver then GET A BLUETOOTH VERSION OF THIS MOUSE INSTEAD. It is called the V270. That is if your notebook has internal Bluetooth or else you will need to get a Bluetooth USB receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your USB receivers. But if you have a Bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the V270 and forget about this USB option. The USB design isn't a fault with the mouse; it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault. You just got to switch to internal Bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers.\n",

       "First and foremost--I am not an audiophile, so I can't comment with any authority on the quality of the headphones themselves.  They are fine for me and my listening habits--I find myself increasingly listening to podcasts when commuting via bus for which these headphones are perfectly fine, although when I do listen to my music the bass and treble response seems fine to me.\n",
       "\n",
       "That being said, what I wanted was a convenient way to carry my 2G Nano so I could listen and manipulate the controls with the iPod handy yet out of the way.  This lanyard does an excellent job of providing that and I would recommend it to anyone.\n",
       "\n",
       "So why four stars?  Well, for a few reasons:\n",
       "\n",
       "--Only available in white.  I have a black 2G 8GB Nano.  I'd have liked to match it.\n",
       "\n",
       "--No lock or release on the base that connects to the Nano.  While the connector does fit snug with the Nano and doesn't disconnect so easily from the Nano that I'd fear it might fall off while walking about, I would have felt more secure with some sort of lock or release mechanism holding it in place.\n",
       "\n",
       "For this reason I would not recommend the lanyard to anyone doing any sort of strenuous activity or exercise--but hanging loose around the neck really isn't the best place for the Nano then anyway.  The armband would be more appropriate.\n",
       "\n",
       "--NOWHERE on the packaging did it say this was for the 2G Nano!  I had bought a 1G Nano lanyard at a local store and had to return it when I discovered it was incompatible (the dock connector and headphone jack on the 1G and 2G Nanos are NOT the same distance apart).  When this 2G lanyard arrived, I could find nothing on the package that said \"for 2G Nano\", so I opened it very gingerly thinking I had received the wrong lanyard and would need to repackage it and send it back.  I was very relieved when it did fit!  Regardless, there should be a very clear \"For 2G Nanos only!\" label on the box to alleviate 2G Nano owners' fears and to warn 1G Nano owners.\n",
       "\n",
       "All in all, I am very happy with the lanyard.  It keeps the Nano handy while leaving my hands free, and that was what I was looking for\n",

       "The Sennheiser HD600s have only one thing wrong with them: they'll change you from someone who enjoys good audio... into an audiophile! I've been known as a videophile for many years over on one of the top AV forums, but I've always been satisfied with merely \"decent\" audio.  Until now.\n",

       "I'd previously ripped all my CDs into the (previously quite impressive) Windows Media format at 192K bps, but that's now useless.  With the phenomenal ability of the Sennheiser HD600s to reveal all the subtle nuances of your music, listening to compressed discs is like listening to your music through a thick layer of vaseline.  Here we go again... it's time to rip everything into lossless format.\n",

       "Having been a buyer of Sennheiser products for over 10 years, I feel it is time I endorse a product I truly believe in, and have never been let down by. Including service and customer satisfaction.\n",
       "\n",
       "Each time buying a Sennheiser product, I found myself stepping up to the next level of their headphones, because they simply keep improving their technology to the point that what you used to own by them gets overwhelmed by the latest headphone they offer. When I bought the HD-600's, I had just come away from years owning the HD-25. When these encountered a technical problem, I replaced them with a backup choice, the HD-25SP's. The difference in sound going 'lower' down their scale of products was just too much to bear. So I bit the bullet and went higher. \n",
       "\n",
       "Whether you use Sennheiser's merely for pleasure, or for studio work, the accuracy of their sound, and what you get for your money cannot be beat. My HD-600's ran into a small technical glitch (and Sennheiser were extremely helpful in getting this fixed and replaced within 2 days of receipt), and I swear I nearly cried in their absence. HD-600's give you a clear idea of how things were recorded, how good your system is, and what truly sounds inferior. You never listen to things quite the same way again.\n",
       "\n",
       "The reason my reviews of Paul McCartney and John Lennon albums from the 70's all comment on how inferior the recording quality is (especially compared to the so called ''Economy Class Beatles'' George Harrison's and Ringo Starr's albums from the same decade), is down to what HD-600's reveal. My main source of media tends to be Vinyl, because Compact Discs and DVD's still cannot capture what analogue/turntable equipment captures. Vinyl is simply warmer and more 'round' in comparison to its digital counterparts. And when listening to badly recorded albums, HD-600's make you wonder if you spent more on your headphones than the artist did using a studio. HD-600's are the reason I mention time and time again you are not getting value for money when buying Lennon and McCartney solo albums. Listening to ''Take IT Away'' from 1982's Tug Of War reveals an annoying tape hiss coming from the left side of the stereofield. Which sounds much like someone forgot to 'silence' a track that had a recording on it, before the instrument actually showed up in the song. It sounds totally like electrical / amp noise coming from equipment, and Geoff Emerick or George Martin just simply forgot to keep this track silent until the instrument that occupied that track appeared in the song. \n",
       "\n",
       "It gets much worse than 'Take It Away' on Paul McCartney albums, and even more painfully so on John Lennon albums. But listening pleasure can be found recording wise on their solo albums BACK TO THE EGG, RAM, DOUBLE FANTASY, MILK AND HONEY, and some portions of BAND ON THE RUN, and WALLS AND BRIDGES. #9 Dream is simply a gorgeous recording, it's just too bad the rest of the album doesn't sound as good as that one song.\n",
       "\n",
       "When you listen to your CD's, vinyl, DVD's in whatever room of your house your speakers are, the room dictates what you hear, no matter what you've spent on speakers, power amps, woofers, sub-dividers, etc. Whether you have wall to wall carpeting, high ceilings, low ceilings, plaster or cement, wood floors, a more long than wide room, it all affects how sound reaches your ear. Which is why on a great set of headphones, you are more likely to hear HOW those sounds were meant to be heard, how they were recorded, and how much time was spent doing it. On speakers, McCartney's JET sounds quite full, though the snare is a little thin. But when hearing the album with HD-600's, the drums nearly become non-existent, and all the inconsistencies of the recording become so apparent, you wonder if the mix was sabotaged by someone. McCartney on drums is not a miracle, especially when you hear many of the mistakes being made by someone not as confident on that instrument as they are on Bass. \n",
       "\n",
       "Can I review anything without bringing up Lennon and McCartney? Quite possibly Dog Food. But so far, they come up pretty regularly. Makes you wonder if I'm trying to prove a point doesn't it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Albums that are phenomenally recorded get due justice with Sennhesier HD-600's. They truly do. Some noteworthy recordings from the 70's and 80's when recording technology (for popular music) was just beginning to reach new highs, that are all HD-600 friendly:\n",

The Voice Up (so you hear each person in a conversation) works very well as do other nice features.\n",

       "Before I bought this device, I was trying to enjoy the \"Hearts of Space\" website, \"This American Life\" and other NPR shows available for online streaming.  Only problem was, I didn't like being shackled to my computer in order to hear them.   I did some research on the internet, read a lot of reviews and ultimately decided on the Logitech Wireless Music System.  I would like to echo all the positive comments recorded here.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was indeed quite fast and easy to set up.  No lengthy manuals to read (thank goodness.)  I did not find it necessary to load the CD software that came with the device.  If I want to listen through the stereo, I plug in the USB.  If I want to listen through the computer, I simply unplug the USB.  It's very simple.\n",
       "\n",
       "I am 100% satisfied with the sound quality.  I would not be able to tell the difference between FM radio and the online streaming.  However, I do have to turn up my stereo about twice as loud when I am sending internet audio streams to it using this device, than when I am listening to a CD or the radio.  On my stereo (which isn't fancy), this does not cause diminished sound quality, so I'm perfectly OK with it.  I just have to remember to turn down the volume before switching back to CD or radio listening.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you are wondering whether the device will be compatible with your stereo, check for two things.  First, your stereo has to have a set of two holes side-by-side that are for the twin plugs generally colored white and red.  I'm sorry I do not know the technical names for these things, but there's a picture of the red-and-white plugs on this Amazon page in the Manufacturer's \"Product Description\" section (just scroll up until you see it.)  Second, your stereo has to have a button that will let you switch to \"Auxiliary\" input.  My stereo has this, but my portable CD player/cassette player/radio (AKA boom box) does not.   If it is important to you to be able to use this on a portable player you can carry around the house and/or outside, be sure to check your player for these two things.\n",

       "The HP12C has been an essential in my personal productivity tool kit for over 20 years. I bought my first one when I was a consultant and it lasted until August 2006. It withstood all the travel and constant use well. I use it for simple and complex math; statistical analysis and financial analysis. It is much faster and simpler to operate than a PC. My new one has all the same great features. I highly recommend this for someone who is frequently required to perform mathematical and financial analysis.\n",

       "I bought this mouse and have used it for over a year now. The nice part about this mouse is the range and the fact that when it works, it works beautifully. When it doesn't work, it is erratic and locks up. Turn it on and off and while the LED will light up, it will still not work well. This is the hint that the battery is low. The mouse comes with two rechargable NiMH AAA batteries. These are 650mAh batteries and are not the best. I bought 4 1000mAh AccuPower NiMH batteries. I keep 2 in the charger. These batteries work great and when fully charged will give me a month of use at about 8 hours a day. But as soon the mouse starts to get erratic, you have to swap the batteries. Do this and you will really like this mouse. \n",
       "Another nice feature for this mouse is the range. You can use your laptop as a DVD player connected to your TV and sitting out of the way. The mouse makes a nice remote control\n",

       "After searching through just about every keyboard available, I was torn between this and a gaming keyboard that was triple the price. I'm so glad that I chose this one.\n",
       "It is excellent! The quick access buttons are great and you can set them up almost any way you want. It's a great keyboard for gaming, office use, media or just ordinary, everyday use.\n",
       "They keystrokes are effortless and near silent. The slide zoom feature is cool, but I don't use it much. It's better to have something and not need it than to need it and not have it though.\n",
       "I really love the quick access buttons which allow me to pull up my files, e-mail or web pages with immediate ease. The only thing I don't like about this keyboard is the sleep button. I NEVER use this and I can't see any way to reasign it. However, it is out of the way and not a big enough deal to lower my rating of this sweet keyboard.\n",
       "Aside from all of that, how can anyone complain about a keyboard of this quality for such a great price. And it was delivered the day after I ordered it.\n",
       "To top it off, it feels sturdy and well made. I would reccomend this keyboard to anyone. It is a great all around keyboard with either USB or PS2 connectability\n",

If I hadn't seen the Creative Zen Vision:M, I probably would have bought the Sandisk Sansa E260.  I love being able to bring my cartoon/tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv.  There is one problem I've had with it.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had this, but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when I'm listening to music.  I don't think it's the MP3s, because I've never ran into the problem with my other MP3 players.  If only they would've added the video cable for the TV and kept the charger, then I would've rated it a 5\n",

       "Bought this DVD player 4 days ago and have enjoyed it ever since.  It has many features and a good picture. You can't beat the large screen. I like the zoom feature especially. Another feature I like is that the battery fits flush with the dvd player in back so that you don't have a bulky protrusion when it's attached.The sound is not loud as others have said but I have yet to find a portable DVD player that has good sound.  You'll have to use external speakers or ear phones(included). Another thing I notice is that DVD-RW or DVD+/- R are not supported. They play but the menu system does not work. You have to access the file manually. That being said I cannot find this size dvd player anywhere else for less than $299.  The shipping was fast and free.  There is a stamp on the manual stating that the unit is sold \"as-is\" but the unit I got was brand new and not refurbished. So far so good.  I don't thonk you will be disappointed\n",

       "I was really pushing the limits of my mid-range Monster surge protector with 2 TVs, a 2.4Gig P4 with desktop TV, DSL, two printers, and .....drumroll please.....a fridge all crammmed into a  corner office setup about 7' wide. The Belkin Gold unit with RF/EMI suppression up to 75db cured all the rattle and hum problems with speakers, satellite signal, the \"dirty\" line into my modem, and a week later I haven't had to reboot my system once. Amazing!\n",

       "I had already had a great experience with a Belkin SurgeMaster on my Home Theater setup, so I went one level up with this \"Gold\" unit. One of the better investments I've made lately. I paid $60 at the local Office Depot, the price Amazon is advertising is ridiculously low at $35. Belkin.com's price is about $70 so my advice is to buy this unit now before somebody at Amazon wakes up  and jacks the price.\n",

The record quality is astounding, full range of dynamics, using both the stereo mini-plug input and the 1/4\" inputs.  It is mostly being used now to plug into sound boards to record long event audio.  First thing I did was to upgrade to a 4GB Compactflash card.  The provided card is too limited.\n",

Then you select record again and it records just fine.  I went several iterations with Tech Support, who were very friendly and helpful, but the problem has not been resolved.  I also suspect the 3rd part flash card may be contributing to this glitch.  I would buy this recorder again\n",

       "I was looking for something suitable to house my sansa, and this fit the bill better than most. The leather case is superb, looking sharp, snug and protective. I enjoy the fact you can still easily access the buttons and menus through it. Both the leather case and the larger case have an atachee on the back, if you wished to connect them to the cord that comes with it. The cleaning cloth works as well as any lense cloth, great for cleaning. The screen protector is a pain in the rear to apply without bubbles, still haven't figured out how yet, and I may trim it to make it more visually appealing. But, really, if you invest in a product such as this, it really makes sense to protect the easily scratched screen! The larger case is compact and protective, having a small storage area, yet the cover is a bit unsightly because of the cheap, generic looking Sansa logo. Only other complaint is that the leather case goes on a belt, but not as a removable type. Only if you put it on when putting on the belt, which can be impractical in some circumstances. This way, I suppose, it wouldn't be able to fall off\n",

       "While thinking of ideas for my church's 75th anniversary celebration, I  decided to make T-shirts and sweatshirts using iron-on transfers and my ink  jet printer. I chose the \"invent it!\" brand from Hammermill  papers because it was the most cost-effective (cheapest). I created the  design on my computer and tried it out on the transfer paper. The results  were outstanding for a do-it-yourself project. I followed the instructions  included with the transfers and it was a piece of cake. One thing that I  did find out - keep the transfers dry after they have been printed. One got  wet in the rain and it spotted very badly wherever a rain drop came in  contact. This product also does a very good job in black and white, not  just in color. The shirts that I did, laundered according to the  instructions, came out of the wash lookin' good. I won't hesitate to use  this product again in the future. However, I am now having trouble buying  it locally, since my previous source no longer handles this product\n",

       "We purchased the YSP-1 in August as a companion to our Hitachi Ultravision wall-mounted television.  What a fabulous piece of audio equipment!\n",
       "\n",
       "When we began searching for a replacement for our Infiniti surround system, my husband and I had different concerns.  He is an audiophile that demands wide range digital sound with full depth of field and I was ready for aestethic simplicity (no speakers throughout the room and wires everywhere).  When we found the YSP-1 we thought it was too good to be true.  One speaker instead of five?  Wall-mounted?  Doesn't take up any floor space?  We visited two Yamaha dealers to see it for ourselves.  One had the YSP-1 set up in a room environment.  The other, on the salesroom floor.  In both set-ups it performed consistantly.  In both demonstrations however, my husband felt the low-end sound could use enhancement.  So, we made the purchase and opted to use the YSP-1 with our existing subwoofer.  Installation was fairly simple, provided you have the necessary tools.  The most important, and time-consuming part was leveling and centering the speaker under the television.  Now that it is installed and in use in our home, I feel the low-end sound is quite adequate and prefer not to use the sub-woofer.  My husband though, prefers the earth-shaking action sequences in movies to mimic their intended theatre quality sound.  More than movies the sound quality you get when listening to CDs is absolutely stunning.  Overall, we both got what we wanted.  Expert sound designation and sleek, minimalistic styling (with the added bonus of more floor and wall space). \n",

The best feature is that they do NOT leak sound yet you can still hear loud noises around you.  This is perfect for an ipod-using NYC subway rider.   Don't want to annoy others by leaking sound, but you have to be able to hear if there is exterior noise, at least enough to know to turn down the sound and find out what's going on.\n",

       "I tried all the rubber vinyl plugs that came with the E3C's, but they all had the shortcoming of not effectively sealing the ear canal making bass very poor, and they were uncomfortable.  The yellow foam plugs are easy to use and work just like the ear foams many people use in industrial applications.  They effectively seal the ear canal and are very comfortable.  Although they seem a bit expensive I've found that once they get dirty you can use water and a bit of dish detergent to clean them.  Just soak, squeeze, rinse and let them air dry and they are as good as new.  You can do this three or four times, then just toss them away.  \n",

       "Once THE speaker of choice for every hard rockin' audiophile with a big enough garage, Klipsch fell off the landscape for a while after being sold to a corporate conglomerate that didn't know the real value of what they'd bought.  But after another buyout by a small group of genuine audiophiles, Klipsch is back on top, from a sound quality standpoint -- and it shows in the ProMedia 2.1 THX.\n",
       "\n",
       "I have my trio connected to a new Mac Pro desktop unit and the sound is absolutely magical.  Yes, there are more complex set-ups, with 5 or 7 speakers spread out across the room, but if you just want the magic without the madness, the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX is an incredible (and very affordable) solution that's quick and easy to configure in about 5 minutes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Of course, there are other 3-speaker desktop systems by makers like Logitech, Cyber Acoustics, and Intec, but here's the difference: Klipsch is a true speaker company that connects great speakers to your computer, while those others are computer peripherals companies that one day decided to make speakers.  NOT the same thing.  The only brands that are true competitors to Klipsch in this area are Bose, Harman Kardon, JBL, and Altec Lansing.  I find that the Altec Lansing and JBL 3-speaker sets both sound nasal and \"tinny\" on the high end, while the Bose and Harman Kardon sets sound great, but are more expensive.  So, after a good look (and listen) around, I went with Klipsch.\n",
       "\n",
       "In any case, this is an incredible sound set-up for your computer-based music player and should not be overlooked.  Enjoy\n",

I used this brand of splitters and a moterola amplifier all the way through, and the results were amazing. The picture quality is crystal clear, even when almost all of the ports are in use, and the internet is blazing fast. Compared to the set-up we used to have, with some cheap splitters and a radio shack amplifier, these pieces are WELL WORTH THE SMALL EXTRA COST\n",

       "On a recent trip, I was 23 hours in transit and couldn't have made it without this little device. It powered my movies and TV shows for at least 12 hours or so without a flicker.

Besides, it was comforting to know that AA batteries are ubiquitous throughout the world. By the way, I substituted the original batteries with Duracells on the advice of previous reviewers\n",

       "I bought this battery pack for a 10 day trip to Italy and I am very happy with it. I never had to change my batteries once and I listened to it all the time. Reading other people's reviews I threw out the batteries it came with and used different ones and it worked great. The only complaint I have is the suction cups aren't that great. Several times my Ipod came off the suction cups and being on a plane with minimal room and people sitting next to me trying to get my ipod off the floor is not fun. \n",

       "I have seen many reviews about problem with the volume control.  I experienced the same thing until I realized that I mistaken the up &amp; down buttons with the + &amp; - buttons.  The volume works just fine on my wife's old Sony receiver.  The remote is quite nice and it does everything the iPod control could do.  As stated in others' reviews, you can't read the screen from a distance, thus rendering the ability to scroll through the menu with the remote a bit pointless.  However, it would be worse if the remote couldn't scroll through menus.\n",

       "It is compatible with the latest video iPod.  I have the 60 gig iPod but I do notice a slight hiss coming out from the speakers.  I listen to classical music and the hiss bothers me.  I bought this for my wife and she is not as picky as I am in terms of sound quality.  Then again, I don't expect high fidelity quality from this small setup.  Since I have this little gadget for my wife, I bought the Squeezebox for myself from Slim Devices to stream music which sounds a lot better.\n",

       "In summary, this dock does a good job and the design is not bad.  The construction is solid and I like the light on the remote.  If you are looking for great sound quality, I haven't encountered any dock that is better than this one, so this might be your best bet.  The Apple A/V cables work fine as well but it is more expensive than the dock and I see more value in this dock\n",

No biggies, though, since setting up is really easy. Basically all you have to do is open the SetPoint software that was installed with the driver, point to the intended buttons that you want to program, and assign a corresponding keystroke to it. In this case, it's Alt+Right for forward button and Alt+Left for back button. Click \"Apply\" and you're good to go a-browsin'!!\n",

       "Until an accident caused one bud to stop emitting sound, these were my favorite pair of earphones. They were comfortable (I often left them in when I went to sleep), affordable, lightweight, durable, and had good sound quality. I used them with my Sony CFD-V5 boombox, my Oritron OP5034 portable CD player, and my RCA RP2410 MP3-CD player. On all three, bass and detail was great, and there was no distortion at a higher volume. All in all, these earphones were a great value; the only possible downside is a bit of fuzziness in the sound, which I got used to rather quickly and began to prefer over my other earphones (it lent a bit of warmth to the music). I plan to buy another pair in the near future, and I highly recommend that you do so as well\n",

       "I received it today, and it's a monster.  If you've seen one in a store, it looks twice as big on your desk.  Until a few hours ago, I was running two 20\" aluminum cinema displays on a PNY 6600GT.  After doing online research about using the 30\" display under Windows XP, I found that the \"functional\" cheap solution being used is in fact the PNY 6600GT (Verto 128MB DDR3 with two DVI connectors).  Considering that the other two most noted solutions, QuadroFX 4000 AGP or Parhelia DL256 PCI, are going for $600+ on ebay, I was willing to give my old beater a try.  Besides, I didn't feel like buying another AGP card with PCIE taking over the world, or sacrificing the only PCI slot in my Shuttle XPC (SB75G2).\n",
       "\n",
       "To my great relief, the monitor worked on the card right away, even showing me the POST and Windows start-up screen (it did for the 20\" displays, too).  But to my absolute delight, the card is actually running both the 30\" and a 20\" in 32-bit color.  The 20\" looks absurdly small next to the 30\", like I didn't water it enough or something.  The 30\" is enormous enough that I think it might be better were it curved!  Maybe I'm just sitting too close.\n",
       "\n",
       "The only problem with the 6600GT is that the DVI jacks are so near each other that I had to take the plastic housing off of the 20\" plug to fit it below the 30\".  I'm not a gamer, so I can't say whether the card performs well for that.  It feels as zippy as with the 20\" on regular windowing tasks.  I use Eclipse, Flash, Photoshop, etc., but no video editing or 3D stuff.\n",
       "\n",
       "The screen had a slight warm cast that I didn't like.  Nvidia's control panel let me adjust it manually, and now my 30\" and 20\" look almost identical.  My biggest fear was of course dead pixels.  By the good grace of lucky ducks, this is the third panel I've gotten from Apple with no dead pixels.  Brightness is uniform but for a very very subtle drop in the far lower left and right edges.  It's not apparent unless you put white there and actively look for it.\n",
       "\n",
       "In any case, I bought it to get more programming panels on the screen at once, and it does a fine job at that.  I'm using the 20\" for browsing and, alas, a few panels that STILL don't fit.  Apple, where's 3840 x 2400??  I strip one star cuz it's crazy expensive.\n",

       "I ordered v8 as soon as it was advertised by Garmin but they shipped v7 instead.  Six weeks later I got the v8 update dvd.  My wife and kids had to make due with v7 while in Madrid.  She was pleased with the accuracy and said it enabled her to travel around with confidence.  However, she noted that Madrid was undergoing quite a bit of major road construction and she got stuck in multiple traffic jams on the major highways.  In the end, she would veer away from the major roads and let the unit re-calculate her route. \n",

I hooked it up, and to my surprise, it  wasn't any better than my old player as far as quality. Then I purchased  S-Video cables from Monster Video and now the colors are more vibrant, the  picture is in higher-res, and I can see every little detail on the screen.  The picture quality that these S-Video cables produce are surpassed only by  component video cables, which cost many times more the price. If you are  considering buying these cables then just consider that for the price of  only one DVD, you can get better performance and picture quality\n",

       "I love sound systems. So when I got my new reciever (Sony STR-DE898/B) I hooked up the new speaker wires with the THX Certified Gold Plated speaker connectors and wow what a difference. I miscalculated how much wire I needed so my rear right speaker does not have the new speaker wire, I can hear a light and day difference in sound quality. Needless to say I'm ordering more to complete the job. The monster fiber optic cable is a must as well. I can hear sounds that I normally couldn't on my old system. I like testing sound with: The Hulk (the scene were he tears up the tanks), Saving Private Ryan (taking the beach), and Open Range (Gunfight at the end of the movie). In all these movies there are small sounds that you can distinctly hear now that I could not before the new wire and connectors. Excellent product\n",

       "This is my first mp3 player so I researched it carefully before making my decision. The gorgeous screen, the wide number of codecs it supports and the 30gb hard drive were all selling points. I'm so glad I bought it. Videos look great on the screen. Some need to be converted over which is a slow process but in general I love it. The built in speaker doesn't do it justice. Even on the included earbuds the sounds quality is amazing. Making playlists with the creative software is very easy. My biggest problem is the lag of accessories for it. No case, no screen protectors out for it. I'd love to see a docking station that lets you record to it as a dvr the way the archos players do. But for the money it looks to me to be a far superior player to the Ipod or the Zune.\n",

       "I did a lot of research on Amazon.com before I finally decided on this mouse.  I wanted to replace my (extremely) small Kensington USB mouse with a retractable cable.  At home, I use a Wacom tablet.  Next month I am traveling abroad, so I wanted a slightly bigger mouse that can handle more frequent use than the Kensington.  Wireless was key for portability.  I also wanted something rechargeable, and I didn't want the USB adapter sticking out.\n",
       "\n",
       "I received it today, and I'm on my first charge.  So no comments on batteries (which can be replaced with other AAA NiMH for optimal performance if desired anyway).\n",
       "\n",
       "- I have large but skinny hands.  Mouse is small, but its long length helps in terms of where to place your fingers.  Of course convenience is not comparable to a full-size mouse, but if you want portability, this is about the right size.\n",
       "\n",
       "- I have a PowerBook that runs Tiger (10.4).  Excellent Bluetooth connection.  Also very good response, very little delay.  Only reservation is for the scroll wheel, which requires subtle pressure for accurate scrolling - this is ever so slightly uncomfortable if you have large hands, because the mouse is flat and your hand is adjusted over the mouse so that it is a bit hard to apply adequate vertical pressure on the scroll wheel from that position.  It is hard to explain, but not a big issue for me. \n",
       "\n",
       "- USB charger works well.  The added size of the USB adapter helps with comfortability (still flat, but becomes an otherwise full-sized mouse) - despite the fact that the cable attaches to the bottom of the mouse.\n",
       "\n",
       "- As mentioned by others, installing the batteries is a challenge.  Pull the notch on the bottom of the mouse as you slide the top (part with the Anycom label) away from the clickers.  Once I figured it out, not so hard. \n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, I don't seek perfection anyway, so this mouse does the job adequately for me.  I haven't tried any other Bluetooth mouse before, so I'm more or less in awe\n",

With the 1200x1600p setting I use on my camera most often, this card holds over 400 photos, and it will hold even more for those using a more email-friendly setting.  Do the math to figure out if 512 is the number for you, but I've had no problems with SanDisk products\n",

       "I have to admit, I'm a GPS junkie.  I've had a variety of GPS units over the past decade and currently own 3 - the c340 being my latest acquisition for use solely when driving.\n",
       "\n",
       "I am greatly impressed with this unit.  It was fast to get going right out of the box and after the initial satellite acquisition and almanac download (for those who are interested, when a GPS unit is turned off and moved a significant distance, say 300+ miles, from where it last thought it was, it needs to recalibrate itself by downloading the current almanac of satellite positions from the GPS satellites.  This can take a few minutes.) In any case, after the initial automatic recalibration, the unit acquired satellites quickly whenever I turned it on.\n",
       "\n",
       "The user interface is very easy to use.  I've used Hertz NeverLost systems for years and have always thought they had a good interface.  I think Garmin's is better.\n",
       "\n",
       "One highly useful feature is the ability not just to search for Points of Interest (POI), but to have the unit search for those points of interest that are along the route you are currently navigating.  This allows you to identify, say, hotels along your route while you are driving and then, using the telephone info provided by the unit, to call the hotels up and see if you can negotiate a lower rate before you arrive - \"let your fingers do the walking...\"\n",
       "\n",
       "If you don't tell the unit where to look, though, it can take quite a while to search for a Point of Interest.  I didn't know which city to specify and I did a search for \"Eagle Rock Rec\" (I was too lazy to spell out \"Eagle Rock Recreation Center\" which turned out to be about 175 miles away) and the unit chugged away for several minutes but eventually came back with the right entry for me to navigate to.  I later realized that even though I didn't know the exact city the destination was in, I did know a city that was near the desired destination.  When I specified that information, the c340 took only a few seconds to find the right location.\n",
       "\n",
       "The advanced user can also create your own POI lists complete with custom icons and load those into the c340.  I have done this for all In-N-Out Burger and Krispy Kreme locations.  The advantage to having your own custom POIs even though these places are in the built-in POI list is that the custom POIs are visible on the c340 map screen at certain zoom levels.  If you are a Geocacher, you can do the same with geocaches, but you'll still need your handheld unit to find the cache.\n",
       "\n",
       "The newer (and more expensive) c5xx units evidently have the Sirf circuitry in them which is more sensitive, allowing signal acquisition indoors, but I found the sensitivity of the c340 to be fine - especially since I have limited my indoor driving lately :-). I haven't tried the c340 under a thick tree canopy with cloud cover yet, so I might change my tune.  The comparable c5xx unit at this price point, the c530, lacks the c340's text-to-speech capabilities (this prevents the c530 from announcing street names).\n",
       "\n",
       "Since I already have a Garmin handheld GPS unit as well as Garmin's MapSource Topo mapping software, I used the unlock code that came with the c340 to unlock my MapSource maps for the unit. I then loaded the topo maps for the entire Western US onto an SD card (between 300-500 MB) and plugged it into the c340 to see what would happen.  It worked!  So now I have the c340's excellent built-in maps and POIs for on-road trips *and* Topo Maps available to me for off-road adventures.\n",
       "\n",
       "One thing you should do if you are in the US is enable the unit's WAAS capability (the default is for WAAS to be disabled).  Enabling this capability increases the accuracy of the unit when certain satellites are in range.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, since this unit has a touch-screen, fingerprints on the screen are inevitable. You should *never* use an ammonia-based product (like most window cleaners) to clean electronic screens - it will cause them to fog.  Instead, use those little antiseptic alcohol towelettes.  They are cheap and if you don't use them for cleaning your touch-screen they might come in handy for first-aid.\n",
       "\n",
       "I give this unit a highly positive rating.  I like it\n",

Recently, the sound is cutting out when communicating with my girlfriend across the country.  I think it might just be her interet connection though (we both have the same web cam).  As long as we restart the video call, then the sound comes back.  I am using Windows Live Messenger as the video call program.  I have never used the cartoons that it comes with.  The video quality is very good when recording a video for email\n",

       "There's no need to take anybody else's word for specs on this Sony DVD player when you can view or download, for free, the user's manual at http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-documents.pl?mdl=DVPNS90V&amp;LOC=3. I've been running this Sony DVP-NS90V player through a Sony widescreen HDTV and a Pioneer amplifier/receiver for several days now, and I find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers. One, for example, states that there is \"no bass management,\" yet you can (a) route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting \"small\" or \"large\" for the front speaker size (see page 76 of the user's manual), and also (b) increase or decrease the bass from -15 dB to +5 dB (see page 77 of the manual). Whether you prefer analog to digital audio, or you think SACD's are tops, is a matter of opinion, taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit. I, for one, prefer DVD-Audio, and I mention this for an important reason: Some product ads and the user's manual clearly warn that this unit \"will NOT play DVD-Audio discs.\" Happy surprize: it most certainly will! For my DVD-A's that have optional Dolby 5.1 and/or DTS tracks, the player simply ignores the primary DVD-A format (normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors) but still plays the Dolby or the DTS via the digital audio (optical or coaxial) connectors. For \"pure\" DVD-A's (without Dolby 5.1 or DTS tracks), it conveniently outputs the audio BOTH via the 6 analog AND the digital connectors. And in all cases above, the audio is full multi-channel surround, and not downmixed to 2-channel PCM, nor Prologic pseudo-surround. The only DVD-A function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on DVD-A's, and so displays only the \"jacket image\" onscreen. The Quick Setup allows any DVD newbie to be up and running in a short time. And the Custom Setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and trouble-shooters that it's bound to please even the high-end audio-video geek-freaks. In short, you'll find this to be a superior universal player, provided you read the user's manual (all 84 pages of it!), follow it, and connect equally high-quality, compatible equipment capable of exploiting its many fine features\n",

       "I've had my Epson 1280 for over two years now and consider it money well spent. I run exclusively on Linux (currently Gentoo) and the Linux support for this printer (using CUPS) is superb. All modes, resolutions, etc. are supported. I use this printer a lot for engineering work printing B-size (tabloid) drawings and it works great for that.\n",
       "\n",
       "Like just about every review states, this printer slurps ink like Homer Simpson slurps beer. Because I don't print many color photos this is not a problem for me--if I was doing that I'd get the Niagara system other reviewers cite. I've researched the Niagara system and  it looks like a good deal for heavy users. \n",
       "\n",
       "My main complaint with this printer--and the reason why it only gets four stars--is the ease with which the heads clog up. This printer wants to be used constantly. If you let it sit for a day or two it's almost guaranteed that one or more of the jets will clog up and you'll get streaks in the output. Then you have to either press the front-panel control or, in more extreme cases, run the head-unclogging utility (on Linux I use mtink) to force the printer to 'blow out' the plugged jets. When the printer does this it blasts ink through the heads wasting even more of the pricey ink. Do this enough and the reservoir the printer blasts the ink into (a sponge-sandpaper-like thing) will overflow and cause the head to smear ink all over the paper. That's when you get out the Windex and paper towels and clean up the mess (google the web for details.) Because of this 'trait' I would not recommend this printer for casual users.\n",

       "Having owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far, I can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results. The drivers at least for Mac OS X are easy to understand and reliable. The ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing, is a vey nice touch as well. However, it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me. By using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings, one can get nice rich colors that are on cue. Thus this printer makes good for doing proofs. As an artist and Graphic Designer, having this quality is a blessing since this print cost $ 400 at the time of parchase. Compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from $2000 on up. Also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers. The only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 1/2 x 11 printer. Also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey. But what inkjet dosen't have that problem? Anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often. So any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it, the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job. So I'm giving 5 stars on the Epson 128\n",

       "I ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins.  Found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor doesn't support anyway.  Originally, the DVI-D specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal, but most manufacturer's have only used the video portion.  If you need a DVI-D cable, an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won't process the audio signal anyway.  There are a few (very few) devices that do use all 24 pins, but with the advent of HDMI, nobody really makes them anymore\n",

       "What a wonderful surprize.  It took about ten minutes to install them to my HP Media center computer.  They replace speakers that came with my 19\" monitor which were lousy to say the least. (speaker make with held) But the vs 4121s surpassed all my expectations.  While I am not an audiophile, I do admire and expect good faithful sound reproduction and these speakers more than do the job.  I don't understand how the more expensive ones can do any better.  Suffice to say I am completely satsfied and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for their moneys worth\n",

       "This is my first time ever buying a really expensive MP3 player.  I bought it three weeks ago.  If I hadn't seen the Creative Zen Vision:M, I probably would have bought the Sandisk Sansa E260.  I love being able to bring my cartoon/tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv.  There is one problem I've had with it.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had this, but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when I'm listening to music.  I don't think it's the MP3s, because I've never ran into the problem with my other MP3 players.  If only they would've added the video cable for the TV and kept the charger, then I would've rated it a 5\n",

       "Earlier this week I received the factory referbished Samsung HD841.  I have had a few days to use it and compare it to my other players, mainly my Philips 642, which have been excellent players for me. This Model does well.  I don't understand why this model has such a rough reveiw.  Note, this model has the DVI output, If your TV has an HDMI port, you will want to check out the Samsung HD 850 (identical otherwise).  First, this model has component, composite and S-video hook ups, as well as the DVI port (still have to run seperate sound out with DVI). Also, this model does feature digital coax sound out and optical sound out as well for systems that can handle 5.1 THX.  Many upconvert models do not have the digital outs on lower priced models. The picture quality is great, at 480p comparable with my Philips.  Again, The upconvert works well out the DVI hook up to my TV, but to be honest, it is hard to tell any difference between it and a good 480p progressive scan player, at least on my tv which is a 23\" 720p LCD.  Menus also are a bit difficult to figure out at first as well.  The user manual is less than impressive at explaining thing, in fact, it does not have an index.  But, it the main thing is that the player is does perform well, and is a name brand product from samsung (I have had some offbrand experience and have had perfomace problems).  THis player also appears to have DivX available on it, not noted in the product discription, so that was a suprise as well.  This will allow the use of MP4 movie files.  The remote again is bigger and at first more difficult than my other players, but after a day or so it actually is better because many of the features are available to change at the push of a button instread of going through the menus.  In all, I will continue to explore this new player, but in all it seems to be a quality product that has received some bad flack.  So give it a chane, the prices are good currently, quality has been good, and it is a Samsung.\n",
       "Note to the technosavy: I have not had luck using the component upconvert code that is available on other web sites, so I am using my DVI input for upconvert.  Also, the new Blue ray (HD 1080p) DVD players are out, so if you have the expensive hi res tvs that can handle this, you might want to wait and save till you can get the new DVD players.  \n",
       "Note 2: the factory referbished models come with a DVI cable, a 20-30 dollar value that many don't come with\n",

We're concerned about battery life as in # of recharges before performance decreases, but no indication right now that is an issue. I would have give the product 5 stars if it had been cheaper. This class of device is overpriced in general. Amazon's price was very good, but overall still seems over priced. I would definately buy another from Amazon as these are 25% more at other places.\n",

       "BREAKING NEWS: If you are buying a new video playback capable iPod, please look for the new iPod Universal dock, which has s-Video output for both photos and video.  It is also ready to accept a control remote so you can control your iPod from your sofa.\n",
       "\n",
       "Is this expensive?  The answer is probably yes.  This dock was included on the original iPod Photo of late 2004 (priced $500-$600), the dock was removed as Apple lowered the prices this year to their current levels for color iPods.  However, for a couple of uses: high quality home audio and Slide Shows on hi-res TVs, it is a great alternative.\n",
       "\n",
       "This dock basically serves three purposes:\n",
       "- The traditional synch &amp; charge function available since the early days.\n",
       "- It helps you get \"Line\" output out of an iPod.  Line output is a cleaner, higher quality sound output than the usual headphone output out of the miniplug jack.  It is the best way to connect your iPod to a home stereo or home theater.\n",
       "- The super Video out for color iPods.  This function is something you cannot get without the dock.  So, if you like to show your pictures to your friends &amp; family using a hi-res TV (Plasma, LCD or a Flat Screen) this is a great tool to use.  As an alternative, if you do not want to use s-Video and are OK with regular digital video out, a cheaper alternative is the \"Apple iPod AV Cable\" at $19 from the Apple Store or similar alternatives.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, buy this if you hook your iPod to high quality audio equipment or if you regularly do hi-res slide shows on your TV.  If you don't do it, it's just too expensive as a synch/charger, since anything you need is in the iPod box\n",

       "I have case logic CD wallets from 7+ years ago that are still in good shape...despite the abuse I put them through.  I bought this one only because of CD collection expansion. I find simply wiping off the outside cover with a wet sponge keeps it clean. The nylon covers really hold up over time. Remember- the \"128 cd capacity\" refers to CDs without their accompaning booklets. It's really 64 CDs with booklets.\n",

       "I am a audiophile and am very picky when it comes to buying my toys. I bought these by accident when i was acually trying to buy the hd650's it was too late to cancell my order and since it was half the price i decided to try them out. I first hooked them up to my denon amp and listened to some cds and they sounded awesome. i could hear things in songs i have never heard before. I then hooked them up to my cheapy portable philips cd player just to see what it would sound like. to my surprise it sounded just as good as hooking them up to my denon amp. There was plenty of bass and highs and mids came out very good. the only draw back is that it is open and it bugs people that are sitting close to you. I am glad i got these instead of the 650's cause my friend owned the 650's and if you don't have a amp hooked up to it your out of luck\n",

       "I'm very happy with this model. I use it mostly as a VCR replacement to record broadcast TV shows. You can't beat the price for this feature-set. I'll try to describe some aspects that aren't mentioned in the other reviews. The owner's manual can also be found online in PDF format.\n",
       "\n",
       "It can schedule upto 16 programs. It does not support VCR+ or a TViO-style program guides. You can enter a title into each schedule that appears both on the schedule list and direct navigator chapter menus. It even sorts the main schedule listing and indicates which events are on the current disk. Every on-screen menu shows you which remote control buttons are functional on that screen.\n",
       "\n",
       "The commercial skip button advances about 60 seconds which isn't quite granular enough, but 2 clicks and a little fast forwarding works well. The remote operations have a very fast feeling response compared to tape players. \n",
       "\n",
       "My only complaint: The remote sensor on the recorder seems to be all the way on right-hand side. When the unit is in our video cabinet, the sensor is in a deadzone for half the room. We can't shift the position much because the disk tray slot is all the way on the left side and won't open if it's too close to the wall. Of course this probably means nothing to you.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the highest quality setting (XP) it made a very good (near perfect I'd say) copy from a 8mm video camera using analog inputs. At that setting, only one hour of content fits on a DVD. The next lower setting (SP) which can hold two hours per disk, the copy from the video camera had some contrast problems. Most TV shows recorded in EP (8 hrs) are acceptable quality although you do see the blockiness and some motion blur at times. This is especially pronounced on animated shows. The four-hour LP setting had no apparent digital artifacts on recorded TV. It also has a Flex-mode option I haven't tried yet in which you tell it how long to record and it will fit the recording to the freespace available on the disk at the highest possible quality.  Probably would be good for recording a TV movie.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's too bad other vendors haven't adopted the -RAM format because most of the features on this box only work on that kind of media, but it won't play on most other equipment. The other formats seem lame by comparison, but this unit can play and record on them. \n",
       "\n",
       "Watching one show while another is recording (or the same show that's recording, but from the beginning) is very easy to do. Most of the operations are very sensible and explained on-screen pretty well, but you should spend some time in the manual if you've never had a dvd recorder before. It can do a lot of stuff.\n",
       "\n",
       "One interesting feature is that no matter what input you are using, the signal is sent through the s-video output.\n",
       "\n",
       "It can't burn music CD's which seems like it would have been a trivially easy feature to add. That and a battery backup (so I won't lose my schedule) and wider angle of view for the remote sensor would required get the fifth review star\n",

I plugged in my equipment to the monster and at first there was no picture only sound.  I have directv and they have a connection which allows you to receive digital and analog signals through the same cable.  That connection needs to be placed after the monster in the connection loop.  After switching around the cables I had a picture again.  I can't really see an improvement in the picture quality (HD is beautiful) I bought the monster basically for the protection\n",

       "The 50G is the successor to the HP 49G. They both accept only a maximum of 1GB SecureDigital flash cards since they only have an approximate 1GB operating system file address space. Only about  0.9GB of the SecureDigital flash cards (a little more on the HP 49G than on the HP 50G) are accessible. The manuals only vaguely state that they recognice FAT16 and FAT32 SecureDigital flash cards. The HP 50G has a black case with a black metallic faceplate. The white and orange shift key labels on the metallic black faceplate have much better contrast and are easier to distinguish than the HP 49G red (or tomato) and turquiose shift key labels on the tan anodized faceplate. The black HP 50G looks tastefully geared for serious users. They still have no display backlighting or a color display. The HP 50G keyboard feels a little more compliant than the HP 49G but it would be nicer if they were as buttery smooth as the original early 1970's series of the HP hand held calculators\n",

       "\n",
       "I am giving this product 4 stars. Why? Because there is only ONE ethernet port. If you have a router, just connect the PAP2 to one of your available ethernet ports and you are good to go. If you do not have a router, consider getting another Vonage phone adapter with built in 4-port router. There are several.\n",

Sling has instructions on their web site but I still had to mess around with my settings in order to get it to work. To work on multiple routers you have to do port forwarding on both routers to port 5001. Once I worked this out everything is great. \n",

I think the longest I have ever waited was 20 seconds.  It does have trouble getting a signal downtown sometimes, when I am surrounded by tall buildings (Wacker Dr.)  But this is expected and can be corrected with the purchase of an external antenna.\n",

       "Soundwise the Klipsch Promedia Ultra 5.1s were everything that they were supposed to be.  The bass is very powerful and can even be overpowering if not adjusted.  The sound is crystal clear and with a decent sound card all of the settings can be tweaked until perfection.  Setup was a breeze and no instructions are needed although they are provided just in case.\n",
       "\n",
       "Something to note is the speaker wire that comes with the speakers is a little on the small size and thicker wires should be be purchased if you are picky about your sound.  The wires themselves are long enough and there shouldn't be any trouble reaching anywhere assuming you are putting these in a normal sized room.  One last thing to know is that there is no optical input for these speakers and only 1/8\" plugs for hooking up the sound source.  If you want optical you're going to have to go elsewhere.\n",
       "\n",
       "Please note that buying these speakers will not make up for having a mediocre sound card or poor music quality.  If you are using most types of on board sound or an ancient soundblaster card it is time to upgrade or else you are just throwing away your money.  Same goes for music quality, if you are listening to an mp3 that is below 128kbps the poor sound quality is because of the shoddy encoding, not the speakers.  If you can't spare the hard drive space for 192kbps its time to get a new hard drive.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall these speakers are a great deal.  While the price tag does seem a bit steep it is well worth the money for anyone that is serious about their music or movies.  For those of you who like to game these speakers will treat you good, however in my past experience a good set of headphones is better than a full blown sound system.  Lastly for those of you who like to play your music and bass full blast, don't bother spending the money.  These speakers should only be purchased by people who actually care about sound quality.  If you are more worried about loudness, do yourself a favor and buy some cheaper speakers, you won't even notice the difference\n",

Also, the clip to fix the cover flap onto the backpack almost is broken after a year of daily use for me.  I have had Dell 14\" and 15\" laptops with the backpack and fitting was just fine for securely hold it inside.  Wearing comfort is pretty good, and things are quite adjustable for your body.\n",

       "I hadn't seen this product in stores as I usually would see the white TuneDok which seemed pretty cool but I decided to buy this one online to go better with my black car (I have a white 40GB 4th generation iPod).\n",
       "The holder is everything you would expect and it did work a little better than I expected. It's very easy to just place the iPod in the holder and very easy to take it off. You can do it with one hand. You just pull back the small tab of the suction thing on the back and your iPod is easily removed and ready to go. The additional cup adapters is an added bonus for those who need them, but the standard one was enough for me.\n",
       "\n",
       "The part that is black and holds the iPod is what seems to be the best thing about the product. As far as I know the cups are the same grey color for both the white TuneCok and this black version, so the difference is only in the iPod holder and not the cups.\n",
       "\n",
       "The only \"bad\" thing I could say is that the cup itself is made of a rubbery plastic that scratches easily. In fact when I was trying to figure out what the adapters were for (before reading the manual..oops), I scratched it quite a LOT trying to fit the two additional cups together. That doesn't affect functionality so it doesn't make me give it less than 5 stars. A small issue you might want to consider as well is that the TuneDok doesn't hold iPods in their cases. So if you're like me and carry your iPod everywhere in a case you might wan to consider having a case that is easy to put on the iPod and remove it to avoid the hassle everytime you want to place the iPod on the TuneDok.\n",
       "\n",
       "I like how the black TuneDok looks with my white iPod. It kind of makes the iPod stand out more than the TuneDok itself. I think the $15 price is pretty reasonable for the white TuneDok, and this one is too if you're willing to pay the extra $5 for it to go with your U2 iPod. But as I said, I think my white iPod looks cooler in my black car with the black TuneDok anyway.\n",
       "Edit: I bought it for $20, but now it's $15. One more good reason to get this one.\n",
       "\n",
       "I'm not too sure, but it seems like the new 5G iPod fits in the TuneDok. If they do, I bet this product is going to turn into a top seller soon enough as the demand for the black iPods is greater than the white one. Maybe someone who gets their 5G iPod can confirm this, so don't buy this for your 5G iPod unless you're already sure or can try it before you buy it\n",

       "I have owned many Sony cameras in the past and am currently using two right now. The only problem I have encountered with any digital camera is that when you think you have enough memory, you run out when you need it most. That is why I upgraded all of my cameras from 256 and 512 meg memory sticks to the Sony 1 gig. Actually I carry a spare 1 gig too where ever I go. \n",
       "\n",
       "Look, when you take video with your digital camera or you use a high file size (3-6 megapixels) per picture, which you should always do to get the best possible prints made, your camera will need a ton of storage space.  Especially if you are on vacation or encounter a great photo moment or maybe even something you hadn't expected like a wildfire, a plane crash, a bank robbery or maybe even a cat in the park having kittens. You can always \"resize\" you photos to a smaller size later when you save then to your computer if you want to save space. Trust me, take large megapixel pics now and you will be amazed at how many shots came out better that you expected.\n",
       "\n",
       "You never know. I have tons of pictures that people ask how did I ever get such good pictures of such amazing things. I have a helicopter crash, police car up a power poll, deer in downtown Oakland, house fire before the Fire Dept got there, tons of wild animals, any many more things I saw while I was driving somewhere or walking in a park. If you want great photos you have to be prepared when the moment arrives!\n",
       "\n",
       "Matching a camera with its name brand memory is also a great idea. No problems ever!! The Sony memory sticks I have from 5 to 6 years ago still work great with no problems. They make it fast and easy to transfer data from your camera to your computer. They are tiny wafer thin and extremely light weight and durable. I have first hand knowledge that products with the SONY name on it are first rate and high quality. If you want quality buy SONY\n",

       "I've used the iTrip by Belkin, the TunecastII by Belkin, and this Monster iCarPlay for getting my tunes to my car speakers.  This is the best design and works the best of the three.  I like that it can charge my iPod and that the transmitter itself is inline.  The signal seems to be decent enough, though of course it crackles sometimes or you hear a bit of static.  This gets more pronounced the louder you make it.\n",
       "\n",
       "I think this is the safest for car use.  The iTrip is a nightmare because you have to change the station through the iPod.  So if you're taking a car trip (I live in NY but went to college in MI -- that's a 12 hour drive) and signals are coming in and out and you need to adjust, you really can't do it safely with the iTrip.  The Tunecast is a bit better, but that runs on batteries (the optional charger/power supply that I got for it didn't work).  Also, you can tune into any FM station with the up/down buttons, which is good, but you really only need the lower stations.  The iCarPlay has 8 frequencies it can transmit over and only 1 button.  Though I feel limited by the 8, I don't think going higher would help because there's more congestion.  I like the single button because there's no confusion whether you're going up or down and you can press the button, then easily tune the radio up a notch.  The other limitation I see is its iPod specific (uses dock connector) whereas the Tunecast just hooks into the headphone jack and it only works in cigarette lighters so you can't use it without a car (or something else with that power source).  But considering I bought it to use in my car, it does what it should and does a decent job of it\n",

       "2. I installed the 9 volt battery first and the unit would not turn on when plugged into AC. Removing the battery, then plugging in the AC, then installing the 9 volt battery allowed it to power up and work normally. The battery installation instructions and general installation instructions did not indicate any particular installation sequence requirements regarding the battery\n",

       "I purchased a Sony WEGA 27 inch tv. I took advantage of it's rear component input labeled video4.  I connected my Sony DVP360 Dvd player.  With dvd viewing, the movie Dinosaur, Bug's Life, Toy Story 1 and 2, and Vegas Vacation, the colors were very vibrant, details were dynamic, and the picture quality was very accurate in at least 480 lines of resolution. I have viewed these same movies on larger screen HDTV's such as the Pioneer Elite and was disappointed??? Glass picture tubes provide a more realistic picture. I can't imagine that I can do any better for my television than these cables.  I am completely happy with dvd movie watching on my Sony WEGA with these Monster component 3 cables\n",

These monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies, especially the dialogue.  The old cables that I had made my movies sound a bit muffled.  But the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever.  For those of us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound, I would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or CDs\n",

       "A sore back and a sore shoulder forced me to search for a better means to carry my laptop.  I took a month to research laptop backpacks and finally settled on the Kensington Contour.  I didn't want to buy a Kensington.  I wanted a backpack making company with a name I knew, like Jansport,or Kelty.  I've been a backpacker and was familiar with their products.  I settled on the Kensington because it had the qualities I was seeking: comfort, quality materials and design, water proofing, laptop padding, urban black, rugged exterior, sophisticated appearance, lots of pockets, adjustable lumbar support with back padding and a water bottle pocket.  I write and work in media for a living.  Mostly I work at home, but once a week I travel to cities.  This pack does exactly what I want it to do - have places for everything I need, protect my precious laptop, and look hip.  \n",
       "\n",
       "So now it is a few months later.  I still like my pack, but twice now the hardware has broken.  The first time it was just the zipper-handle on the little outside pocket. It fell off.  Kennisington immediately replaced the pack for free.  Last week at the airport the tab that holds and adjusts the left shoulder strap-- broke when slung the pack across my back. I haven't contacted them yet\n",

       "I had a small 512 Sandisk a while back, so when I saw a review for the Titanium 2GB Cruzer in a popular computer mag, I decided to upgrade from my Lexar 1GB.  So far, I'm very impressed.  Just did a 1.26GB transfer that took 140 seconds.  I was a big leery of the included software, but was pleased to see that if I didn't care for it, it was easily removed.  I have not had an issue with either the software or the drive, and am very impressed with the design of the retractable interface that requires pressure to expose or retract.  This is a very good drive, and contrary to the negative comments, I would encourage anyone looking for a fast, stylish, practical jump drive to seriously conside the Titanium Cruzer\n",

       "Let me just preface this review by mentioning that I read many customer reviews(here and elsewhere) on this product before purchasing it. I focused on the negative reviews as to develop a good idea of any potential design flaws. After using this keyboard for almost 6 months I believe that Saitek delivers an attractive design with solid quality. \n",
       "\n",
       "Command Pad: Many reviews bash this feature. It is quite a basic pad as compared to some, but it gets the job done. My only main gripe with the pad was how it failed to deliver some windows macros such as ctrl-alt-delete. During games such as WoW and CoD2 I had no problems whatsoever. The rumor about the horrible software and it being buggy was nonexistent for me. The customers who claimed it to be \"impossible\" and \"buggy\" seem to be computer illiterate at best, and judging from the frequency of grammatical errors in their reviews, possible English illiterate as well. If you are familiar with computer hardware then you will be fine with this software and pad.\n",
       "\n",
       "Keyboard: The quietness, response, and overall feel of the keys rival any Logitech design. I am a huge fan/customer of Logitech equipment, and thus can confidently state that this board is of equal material quality. Saitek took a more simple route with this design(no LCD screen etc...) and the price shows it.\n",
       "\n",
       "*I almost laughed out loud after recently reading some of the passionate and disgruntled reviews concerning the lack of key-symbol illumination. It is obvious that these reviewers did not know much about the product they purchased. Unfortunately failing to be informed about a product one buys totally demerits any kind of negative opinion resulting from that lack of knowledge. I would guess that 90% of the negative reviews about this board capitalize on this point resulting in a much lower overall rating than deserved. \n",
       "\n",
       "Last and probably least comes the aesthetics, of course the most subjective part of any review. I found this setup to be very sharp looking. In the dark, the vivid key definition from the backlights allows any experienced typist to quickly find whatever he/she is looking for. This eliminates the need for symbol illumination. Although symbol illumination might be a nice touch, especially for the keyboard deficient, I feel that Saitek sacrificed this option to provide very durable lettering. I have lost some lettering on Logitech keyboards sooner than the 6 months I've been using this one(Although frequency of gaming has fluctuated). Saitek Engineers probably figured that most gamers would know the keyboard well enough to not need both key definition and symbol illumination, apparently an oversight on their part. \n",

What separates this skin from other skins it the Visor (a plastic shield which protects the screen).  My only problem with this skin is the belt clip.  It is impossible to remove and difficult to use.  A better belt clip would make this the perfect skin.  This is a very good price from TechGNet. \n",

       "I have long struggled to find the perfect remote.  The URC9910 isn't it, but its pretty good.  Its no match for my Harmony 880 but it also costs a whole bunch less and works through walls.  I have 2 URC9910s, both programmed identically for my main HT.  The cabinet also contains a second reciever and a sound distribution center for the other rooms in the house.  The kids can be using one URC9910 with the TV/HT and I can be in the basement or outside and control the volume of my music with the RF part of the second URC9910 remote.  For the price you can't beat it.  All buttons AFIK are progammable or mappable.  Setting it us is a pain and I had to find some pretty obscure codes on the internet to get my TV to do its thing so that is where it looses a star.  Otherwise its a great performer and with the price, I don't mind if my kids use it, whereas, they aren't allowed to use my Harmony 880.\n",

       "I got the newer model of these, with the blue light on the speakers . All I can say is that these speakers are worth the money. You get what you pay for. These speakers have pretty good highs in them, bass wise there decent. They hit alright, and sub decent. You pay more money, you get a better system you know. This system here isn't much money, so it isn't going to be the best. So there isn't no reason for the bad reviews. I think they work really good for the price their tagged at. So if your looking for a system with some good highs, and decent bass these are for you\n",

       "I bought a 32 inch 5 years ago.  in 2003 when movie I was trying to move it across the room and it flipped face first in the floor.  Mind you I had paid like $200 for Sear's sorry 3-5 year? warranty and it turned out they wouldn't have replaced it or probably fixed it even though my sister worked there.  I heard a sickening crash (like the picture tube/glass breaking).  It still works and only has a dent it the top left.  I think I got the remote a little wet years ago and it never worked again.  Not a big deal since I have a directv remote,but I forgot I even had PIP because of no remote.  From now on if I can afford it I will buy sony only.  I bought an xplode cd player 2 years ago with no problems except a dead remote that I never use\n",

       "This TV weighs a ton, took three adult males to pick it up off of the floor and load it into an entertainment armoire. I have owned several Sony TVs and really thought hard about this purchase because of firmware issues that I have had with a 27\" Sony. Mainly compared this model with the corresponding Panasonic Tau, absolutely hated the Tau remote and am very familiar with the Sony. Note that the remote was not the deciding criteria, but it was a consideration. I have no real complaints about this TV, the menu system is nice and the picture very good. I do not normally use the built-in speakers so really can't comment about their sound. This TV has a 16:9 enhanced mode that must be selected from the menus, I tried it once using a DVD as source input and liked the widescreen format that the DVD player provides better than the 16:9 mode. The 27\" Sony that I have has an auto-volume feature, this 36\" does not and I do miss it. I would purchase this unit again. Note that there is a very similar Sony model that has upgraded sound, but not consider it because the added width would not fit in the armoire\n",

What a monitor stand does is it raises the monitor to make it easier on your neck to view.  I have an IBM laptop and I place it on top of the stand.  With the stand, I probably have to look down at most about 10-15 degrees.  Before the stand, I would have to look down at about 35 degrees.  This does not seem like much, but if you spend alot of time staring at a computer screen, your neck will be sore.  Buy this stand and your neck will thank you. \n",

The only complaint that I have is that the plastic window that covers the dial pops open, and even falls off at times.  I still give the case a 4 star rating, because I am a soldier in Iraq, and this case is doing a very good job of keeping my IPOD clean.  If a product can keep something clean in Iraq, then I am guessing that it can keep things clean anywhere. \n",

       "I agree with most of the reviews here.  The PC155 is a great headset overall.  The sound quality is great.  Volume is more than adequate and fidelity is excellent.  I've listened to a great deal of MP3 music through these babies and I am very impressed.  Spacial/stereo imaging is great and I've actually heard things in the songs that I have never heard before!  It actually shows the imperfections of my MP3 and makes me realize that I probably need to turn up the bit rate when ripping my CDs.  The controls are also simple to use, both on the cord and on the PC.\n",
       "\n",
       "Audio recording quality is great as well.  I have tried it with Dragon and recognition works great with it.  Playback of recorded sound shows that the sound is a little on the dark side, however.  Ps and Bs are a little too hot even though I have tried different mike positions and used the included wind sock.\n",
       "\n",
       "My biggest problem with the set is in the comfort department.  I first feel obligated to tell you that I do not normally wear full coverage headphones.  Usually, I wear high-quality buds.  So, perhaps I just have to get used to it.  However, I feel as though my ears are being squeezed too much with these headphones.  Instead of feeling like they are comfortably secure, they feel as though they are too tight and they make my ears hot... even after only 15 minutes.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, despite my positive review of the sound quality, I am going to send these back and try the PC165.  They supposedly have bigger ear cups, which will hopefully translate to more comfort?  Other people here have not had problems with the comfort of the 155s so it is probably just me.\n",
       "\n",
       "UPDATE: I received the PC165 set and there is a big difference.  The sound is fuller and bigger (not louder) on the 165s.  Also, the comfort is much better.  They don't pinch my ears like the 155s.  The cord going to the headset is also thicker, which means fewer tangles and less chance of damage.  If you're thinking of the 155s, I would get the 165s instead\n",

       "I purchased this headset for use with my Mac dG5 and Skype internet telephone.  The combination is killer.  I cannot compare to other similar equipment as this is my first and only, but for me, the quality is far better than what I have with my phone, and it was really as easy as plug and play.  I wish that the headset had thicker and stronger wires; I wish that the headset was more sold.  On the otherhand, I have not had any problems with the equipment up to now.  And the sound quality during telephone conversations is steller, which is important to me, especially as my hearing starts to deminish.  I saw some comments about the headset as an audiophile listening headphone.  IMO, this is too complementary.  For its price and features, a good buy and good sound quality, but IMO, this is not an audiophile headphone. \n",

       "I've gone through a ton of headphones in recent years. They've included Koss \"The Plug,\" Sennheiser PX100, Koss UR29, Koss SportaPro and a few others. All had their strong and weak points. So far, this has been the closest I've had to a good balance.\n",
       "\n",
       "For my tastes (not necessarily anybody else's), strong bass is one of the most important things. The PX100 felt very weak in this area, despite what everybody else seemed to say -- weaker than my old Sony MDR-NC20 (which are still going strong after 6 years and remain my backup headphone of choice thanks to their decent sound and folding ability). I had problems keeping \"The Plug\" sealed in my ears, despite the \"hold the outer ear while the Plug seats\" advice. They're also a very a bad choice for iPods because their very low impedance overdrives the amplifier circuit. The SportaPros had great bass, but leaked way too much sound. The UR29 had good bass and very good isolation, but were a little uncomfortable, warm, heavy and too bulky to use on the go. Going back a few years, I had a pair of AKG K240s that had disappointing bass. Ditto for a pair of Sennheiser HD-420s.\n",
       "\n",
       "The K26P seems to combine the better aspects of all these phones. The bass is among the strongest. When I listen to the 1812 Overture, the \"cannon blasts\" come through loud and clear, even at moderately low volumes, with no distortion at all. Isolation isn't as good as the UR29, but not too bad. Certainly a lot more portable, easy to stow in my bag at all times. The PX100s fold smaller, but they're a pain in the neck to stow in their hard case. The higher efficiency of the K26P means I can set my iPod at a lower volume. Instead of 55-60% of max volume with the UR29 or the stock earbuds, I now run at 35-40% comfortably. In terms of comfort, they're comfortable enough for hours of wearing, after a couple of slight modifications. If they press too hard on your hears, first extend the headband all the way, then GENTLY straighten each half a little bit by gripping a couple of inches of steel band at a time and unbending it. After a few tries, it should be perfectly fitted to your head. Don't bend too hard or grip the plastic parts or you can break the phones. Be patient. So it takes a couple of days of trial and error, but in the end, you get good-sounding phones that are wonderfully comfortable. You'd be surprised how little pressure is needed to produce a good seal. You'll know if you've unbent too far because either the phones will slide down or you lose bass. Here's an easy test: with a finger on each side, press the earcups harder onto your ears. If the bass doesn't get stronger as you press (the way it does with all open-air headphones), that's as good a seal as you need. I hated the little, square foam pads on the plastic sliders and quickly peeled them off. All they seem to do is create two pressure points on top of the head. Other phones with similar headbands (like the Koss SportaPro/PortaPro) don't use these pads, so I don't think they're really necessary. Better to let the headband rest directly on the scalp and distribute the pressure over the entire headband, and so far my suspicions seem to have been correct. It has been far more comfortable for me without the pads, especially after more than half an hour. In fact, without the pads, I barely feel the headband at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, I'm satisified, especially at its low price point. I hope to use these for many years to come until either they break or something better comes along. By the way, don't be put off by comments about the warranty being invalid in the US and Canada. Read the whole warranty sheet! A separate section on the sheet covers a limited warranty for these countries, so yes, it is covered\n",

       "I initially purchased this model then returned it in favor of the Sony SRF-M37V because of its five one-button pre-sets which make it a no-brainer to use while exercising.  However, the SRF-59, perhaps because of its analog tuning, suffers less from co-channel and adjacent channel interference on FM.  It's audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin.  With this in mind, I purchased another SRF-59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it.  I literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed I was having so much fun scanning the FM dial.  There was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured bass-heavy 12\" remixes of eighties new wave hits with, blessfully, very limited commercial interruption.  Over the course of a three hour listening session, I gradually cranked up the volume.  As I was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds, it became apparent that with bass-heavy audio at very loud volumes the SRF-59's tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock Walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality (I understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output, therefore there will be no audio clipping).  Nevertheless, the sound quality from this bargain-priced Walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding.  The party is literally in your head, and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear, which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses.  I also made one pass through the AM band and there the SRF-59 was no slouch either.  I hauled in 1200 WOAI San Antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me.  Though no true DX machine, after all how could it be, it is at the least a competent performer on the AM band as well (I suspect early in the evening AM DXing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time).  For more on this model and others visit Xin Feng's website.  I highly recommend this model for cheap thrills!         \n",

       "I bought this item rather than the cheaper products advertised because I trust Toshiba and because the picture quality was better than average.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the product.  We have used it on several aiplane trips and my toddler is very entertained.  We haven't had any problems with the mechanics of the player.  We also bought a case (which I highly recommend) so that we have enough Baby Einstein to keep her happy to our destination.  Also, the battery has never run out, and charges quickly.  My only problem with it is that the volume doesn't go up loud enough without earphones to hear it very well in a roaring commercial airliner.  But, my daughter mostly looks at the pictures anyway, so it wasn't that big a deal for us. \n",

The case that keeps the dvd player on the back of the seat needs a little work, but we figured out a way to make it work for us.

Most of the others had so-so features or bad enough reviews that made me pass on them; however, with the 5-star review and Cuisinart name, I chose the TOB-30BC.  It toasts, it bakes, it looks nice and it has the knobs that my hubby likes in lieu of digital. Overall, it's a great oven and we have no complaints with it's cooking abilities or the sturdiness of the unit; but less than a month later, one of the knobs broke off the unit. They are completely plastic and no metal reinforcement to prevent this from happening. My hubby sent an email to Cuisinart and they are sending a replacement knob, but one would have expected better engineering from a name like Cuisinart\n",

       "I bought this headset and I must say it's a great buy. First off it's lightweight weighing in at about 16 grams. It's small which definately helps when your wearing it around. At times it's like you don't even feel liek your wearing anything. Exactly how a headset should be. I've place and recieved many calls with it already and having been using the the traditional wired headsets of the past this headset sound better and has no wires. The only problem I have found so far is that it takes some time getting used to the button placement and answering calls with the headset. Not to mention you only hear the standard ringtone rather than your custom ringtones. But that a small price to pay for such a great, inexpensive headset like this one\n",

       "Overall, I like this surge protector and would buy it again. I bought it primarily because of the 11 outlets, six of which are spaced out to accommodate big brick-style transformer plugs. I did a lot of digging to find the surge protector that had the most outlets in this configuration, and this unit always came up.  It has worked just fine for the month or so I've owned it. I particularly appreciate the angled plug, which allows you to use the second plug in a wall outlet without a problem.\n",
       "\n",
       "I only have two quibbles with the APC--the color and the stiffness caused by the plug-activated safety shutters.  Plugging and unplugging cords requires some force to overcome the safety shutters, which could be a problem if you are trying to get something plugged or unplugged while the unit is in an awkward position or hard-to-reach location.  On a much more minor note, the black unit and cord stand out quite a bit against light-colored walls and carpets, even when tucked behind a desk.\n",

Horrible support for the ears and very uncomfortable to wear and they eventually broke within a week or two. So I bought this headset and I have been quite pleased with it. The mic output is extremely crisp. While talking with clients they said that it sounds like I'm talking on the telephone with them or better. They are very comfortable and rest on the top of your head unlike many headsets like my prior pair which have a support on the back of the neck which does nothing. All in all a good headset.\n",

       "There are lots of reviews here and most appear to be on-target relative to my experience with these headphones.  But here are my 2 cents:\n",
       "I got these to replace some aging Sony MDR-V2's that I purchased maybe 10 years ago.  The ear cushions of the MDR-V2's had begun to deteriorate, and I figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years.  I just compared them to the older V2s and I can say that the V6 is definitely better.  They fully surround the ears (V2s just sat on your ear, pressing on them).  The V6s also seem to offer more detailed sound.  I concur that they sound a little bright, but I can take care of this on my iPod by setting the EQ to ReduceTreble (but I like the brightness, so sometimes I don't do that).  I do NOT concur with other review comments about weak bass.  They appear to have the right amount.  (IMHO - it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade, at the expense of flatness and non-coloring of sound).  I also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good (plenty loud for me with the iPod - and I listen at good levels - albeit not ear damaging ones).\n",
       "As a last comment, I notice Amazon has these for about $65.  I paid $99 at a local store.  Buy from Amazon !  (no - I don't work for or invest in them ;-\n",

       "I bought these after reading over a hundred reviews for them, and I agree with the consensus that they deliver a flat, uncolored sound with tight, but not boomy, or overpowering bass. By the way, I've owned the Sony MDR-V600's for a couple of years now thinking they had replaced these, but they are actually more of a consumer model that seem to be comparable in terms of price and specifications, but are actually quite inferior to these in my opinion. These have been used by Musicians, studio engineers, and on air talent for 20 years now\n",

The only negative thing that I've discovered is that sometimes it disconnects from the iPod slot and I have to push it back.  That's mostly due to rattles and I imagine will get worse with time.  \n",

       "I have had and used two pairs of these headphones over the last year. I have been very happy with them, and even bought the second pair to keep as a backup. \n",
       "\n",
       "The Good: They are not only noise-cancelling, but they also are rubber earbuds which fit snugly and comfortably in the ear, blocking more noise. If you put them on without any audio source, in only dulls background noise, but I think that's the best you can expect from any pair. While listening to audio, nearly everything is blocked out unless you really listen for it. There is a neck strap with the noise-cancelling component in the middle and the two earbuds hanging from each side. You put it around your neck like a necklace, put the buds in your ears, and use the power and volume controls on the noise-cancelling piece.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Bad: Nothing is actually \"bad\" about them, but they're not quite perfect. The earbuds will easily slip out if you're sweating, or if they get at all greasy from your skin or earwax. However, they pop right off and you can wash them with a little soap and water in about 10 seconds. I do this daily when I use them. However, that doesn't make them the best solution for walking or jogging. Once one starts slipping, it generally won't stay in well until it (and your ears) have been cleaned, which detracts from the noise-cancelling effect. \n",
       "\n",
       "Other Thoughts: The cord is plenty long enough to reach an iPod or whatever at about belt level. However, if the player is in a pants pocket, it could be a little close. Also, I often wear it when I'm not using it, because you can forget it's there, and also it beats putting it into a pocket to get tangled. I had an issue once because I was sitting at a desk, and it dangled to the floor. When I stood up, I stood on the end and the force of my neck going up while my foot held it down damaged the wiring -- I began to get a slight buzz in one ear. However, I blame myself for that -- it was a mighty tug.\n",
       "\n",
       "I bought mine at Target, where they were labelled $24.99, on \"clearance\" from $49.99. A couple of months later they were back to $49.99. Once they dropped again to $34.99 (another \"clearance\" price), I bought a second pair as a backup. I'm glad I did -- I'm still using the second pair. Battery life is great. I don't know how many hours I get, but I can go at least a couple of weeks using my iPod for at least a couple of hours per day, listening to podcasts and audiobooks\n",

       "\n",
       "I purchased these for my office desk where I wanted a crisp sound for low volume daily listening. Anything from Ambient, to Rock and Jazz. They produce sounds nicely, nice tight crisp. If these came with a woofer unit these would be ideal speakers, as the 2-pieces alone do not produce any significant bass at all. Just the \"hints\" of bass in the music but no thud, if that's what you are hoping for. I did turn these up loud to listen to their full sound and they do sound good.  These are perfect for offices and just daily music, sound is superb. Not for audiophiles or for people who are expecting to shake everything on their desks. \n",
       "\n",
       "Build quality is \"ok\". I got the white speakers and they are the nice \"Mac\" white plastic. The JBL logo on the speaker itself is awfully big. And the silver volume knob is made of that cheap silver flake paint over plastic which is abit tacky. One of the soft rubber pads on the bottom of these (meant to not scratch your desk) did fall off during opening but they are glued on so no big deal in placing it back on.  \n",

       "I bought this laptop stand when I found out that my laptop could drive dual screens so I could have different items on the two screens and drag stuff between them.  So now I have the center of the screens at the same height, side-by-side.  It is really nice to have twice the screen real-estate.\n",

       "I figured that mostly I would put background stuff on the laptop screen (like email) and use my big hi-resolution screen for what I was activly working on.  But, now that the laptop screen is up at eye level, I tend to use it just as often as the big monitor!  It turns out that my dislike of the laptop screen had more to do with having to look down at it, even though I was not aware of that until I got it raised. \n",

With this stand I am able to sit with great posture and look straight ahead to my screen. I would definitely suggest getting one of these if you've ever thought about raising your monitor up off the desk\n",

       "As you may already know, this is an accessory handset which will only work if you have one of these Panasonic models: KX-TG2700/KX-TG2720, KX-TG2730/KX-TG2740. \n",
       "\n",
       "The Panasonic KX-TGA271V, does not need (or use) a telephone jack. It simply plugs into any standard electrical socket and works off the base unit with one of the models mentioned above.\n",
       "\n",
       "This phone was also very easy to register. (It had to be charged for about 2 hours before it could be registered...) I simply had to press the \"MUTE\" button on my base unit and then press the \"PLAY\" button on the phone (the registration directions were even displayed on the LCD display on the phone!) Please know that I did find the Panasonic instaltion manual/registration directions to be a little confusing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some features that are NOT mentioned in this description which ARE included are: finger grips/ergonomic sizing on the sides of the phone, the opportunity to play your answering machine messages off this phone (the base unit to the KX-TG2730 has a digital answering machine, and I suspect the other Panasonic models do as well) ---- THIS WAS THE MAIN REASON WHY I PURCHASED THIS PHONE, YES THE KX-TGA271V WILL PLAY YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGES OFF THIS PHONE THROUGH THE SPEAKER ON THE BACK OF IT!!!, a separate \"call waiting\" dedicated button is also included.\n",
       "\n",
       "Also, this phone will use any standard headset, it does NOT need a Panasonic branded headset. This was very important for me because I ofen use a headset and I do not want to purchase another one. I have since learned that ALL cordless phone headsets can be used on ANY type of cordless phone! \n",
       "\n",
       "Please know that the batteries on this phone are not interchangeable with the KX-TG2730 system (that is the model that I have.) Also, the KX-TG2730 phone can't be charged in this charger, and vice versa. That is (likely) because the KX-TGA271V phone is slightly smaller and weighs less. \n",
       "\n",
       "The face of the phone is white with a purple trim. The back of the phone is also purple on the bottom and white on the top half. The \"white\" in the phone is sort of a shiny metalic white, and the \"purple\" is not shiny at all. Some of the buttons are also slightly smaller than the buttons on the KX-TG2730 model. And the LCD screen is not flat, it is indented slightly, and bordered in silver. \n",
       "\n",
       "I purchased this phone from an Amazon.com merchant and am very pleased with it. I noticed that another Amazon.com merchant is selling the same phone that I purchased for less ($30.), however that merchant has HORRIFIC feedback and I was only too glad to pay a little extra for the confidence of knowing that I would receive a phone in a timely manner that would work! \n",
       "\n",
       "Panasonic makes very good phones. The only (big) problem is the battery life. The batteries often die after less than 90 minutes. I have solved this problem by purchasing a second set of batteries. However, this is still not a perfect solution. So, I had to purchase another set of cordless phones (Uniden.) I now keep two phones in each of the rooms that I had each of the Panasonic phones, and so far have not run in to any problems. I hope Panasonic will offer batteries with longer lives soon.\n",
       "\n",
       "All in all this is an excellent phone. I hope the extra details that I provided will help a prospective buyer make the right decision. Amazon.com rarely provides specific details to these types of questions (does Amazon.com only employ braindead dimwits?) and the Panasonic Website does not offer this info\n",

       "I recently bought an HP 17\" widescreen laptop and needed to find a case for traveling. This case is all that and more...on one side is a detachable cell phone case...the other side a HIDDEN drink holder. It has a pocket that it slides into if not needed- that came in handy in the airport.\n",
       "\n",
       "This case looks extremely sturdy (well built!)and dirt just seems to wipe right off of it. It holds my 17\" laptop, PDA, Cell phone, computer mouse, one-time-use cameras, Ipod, and all the wires and chargers for those electronics. I even fit two books, keys, a folder filled with directions and plane tickets, a notebook, and two dvd's in here. (all of that at the same time) Granted, all that stuff makes it pretty heavy to lug around the airport, so if you are doing that routinely you are going to want something with wheels or backpack form. The strap on this bag is extremely sturdy and cushiony. The strap was long enough for me to wear it diagonally accross my chest if I wanted, but it is not detachable (which means it isn't likely to fall off easily).\n",
       "\n",
       "This bag is extremely well-designed. There is a strap for attaching it to wheeled luggage...it even fits under the window seat of the airplane and those areas for storage are much smaller than the aisle seats. Very well padded..I knocked my brand new computer around a bit during the travels and kept opening the case to make sure it was okay! Of course it was fine because there are 3 heavy duty layers of padding.\n",
       "\n",
       "Because this bag does all that and more, it is large. It becomes larger the more you stuff it (obviously). However, I am 5'1\" and I carried it fine from North Carolina to New York. It looks great, if I needed to go to a meeting with my laptop I would gladly take it in this case. It looks professional enough.\n",
       "\n",
       "happy buying!\n",
       "ps. let me add that finding a decently priced case for a 17\" laptop that has all the features this one does is nearly impossible. Also, in the stores I checked this was sold for about 30 dollars more than here on amazon!! If you have a smaller laptop, this case will work just fine too! It has an adjustable divider. You will just gain more room for other stuff. I look foward to long usage of this case.\n",

       "I've read the other reviews of this product and feel a need to defend this gadget. I've owned mine for about three years and I love it. I use it nightly. The application I find this perfect for is Audio Books stored on MP3. This of one of the only small, portable MP3 players that has it's own speakers. I go to bed listening to audio books and I don't want to wear a pair of earphones or lug a set of extra powered speakers around. However just slightly larger than a CD Walkman when folded closed it is small enough to work great on an airline trip, where headphones are preferable to the endless roar of the planes engines.\n",
       "\n",
       "The big gripes I've seen repeated in the other reviews are:\n",
       " 1) Poor radio reception.\n",
       " 2) No Bass from the mini speakers.\n",
       " 3) Short Battery life.\n",
       "\n",
       "1) I never use this to listen to the radio, so I won't comment on it good or bad. But there are thousands of good and cheep radio's on the market so if you need a radio, go buy a radio.\n",
       "\n",
       "2) I'll agree with the poor bass reproduction in the speakers. Small cone's yield small bass. It's a physics thing. However when I travel and use this to play music in a hotel room, it's been good enough to satisfy the want of a little background music.\n",
       "\n",
       "3) Battery Life. I'm surprised by the times listed by other reviewers. I get about 30-35 hours of use when I'm on the road using the AA's. When at home or in a hotel, the AC adapter removes the concern about battery life completely. \n",
       "\n",
       "Perhaps this is because I primarily play MP3 disks which it spins up to read into it's buffer then spins down until it needs more data. \n",
       "\n",
       "Anyway I wanted to toss in my two cents, as this is a great gadget for audio book listeners, and I would hate to see someone miss out on it because some reviewers expected the performance of a boom box or home stereo out of a Walkman sized device.. It's my hope that we'll see more devices like this on the market and the price point to come down a bit. But bottom line, I've got my monies worth, and if anyone doesn't want theirs, I'd be glad to take it off their hands.\n",

Unbelievably durable for a mouse pad heavily used for hours everyday for five full years. Fed up with giveaway mouse pads sliding with my hand movements, I was searching for something decent to use in the office and amazingly found the exact same item. It is a good example that how little things make a big difference\n",

       "I researched cases upon receipt of my 20 GB iPod and deemed this the best.  This case consists of a thin plastic sleeve inside a separate clear, hard shell.  The hard case protects the iPod from scratches and minor falls while still allowing easy access to the controls and inputs.  It also does not obscure the screen.  An enclosed plastic belt clip attaches to the back of the unit.  \n",
       "This case is not compatible with a Bose Sounddock as the user must remove the iPod from the case.  Also, Contour Design only enclosed one of the thin plastic sleeves.  I spent $5 at their website for 5 more sleeves and gave some to friends with the same case.  \n",
       "The price seems high for a couple pieces of plastic but a case is essential and this is the best one for the 20 GB iPod. \n",

This allows you to play any game with the controller, even ones which don't naturally support gamepads like Splinter Cell.  With the \"shift\" profile function, you can effectively double the number of buttons which I found great for playing a complicated flight sim like X-Wing Alliance, completely keyboard free, using only the gamepad.\n",

This made the D-pad more or less unusable for games like Street Fighter, but then the analog stick was a perfect alternative anyway\n",

       "First, I should say that I'm surprised at how sharp and clear the image is.  The display card at CompUSA said this monitor has a 1000:1 contrast ratio, and I'm not sure what that means, but it definately seems to translate to a crystal clear picture.  The contrast ratio is higher than most other flat-panels I looked at, which have a contrast ratio of around 500:1 to 700:1 (including Samsung's own 20.1\" non-widescreen model).  Everything is crystal-clear, which makes it easy on the eyes and good for watching movies.  It is also good for gaming - Half-life 2 and Unreal Tournament 2004, for example, both look great.\n",
       "\n",
       "Its wide-screen resolution of 1680x1050 is more than decent for most tasks.  It also has a feature that lets you change the aspect ratio to 4:3 (which makes a square picture centered on the screen), so if you have any games or other applications that don't support widescreen modes, you can use 4:3 mode so that the picture doesn't look stretched and distorted.  Plus, the monitor has DVI, analog VGA, S-Video, and RCA inputs (which would allow you to plug in a DVD player if you want).  The monitor can also rotate 90 degrees, and it has built-in speakers and a headphone jack.\n",
       "\n",
       "Being a flat-panel display, it is also lightweight and compact, which is ideal for areas where space is limited.  This is my first flat-panel display, and I was surprised at how lightweight it really is.\n",
       "\n",
       "All of these features, especially the sharp image, make this a great monitor, and it is worth the money\n",

Right now I loop the excess around the steering wheel but then again I never change the adjustment on the steering wheel so no problem with the wire getting caught up in the adjusting mechanism. Others may run into this problem. The alternative is a shorter wire but then it would make the power unit useless for some vehicles. A minor hitch but not earthshaking.\n",

The sound is in line with a radio/boom box of the same size and it's about the same weight. I have a lot of trees around my house so I have to extend the antenna several feet out the back door in order to get a good signal. Keep that in mind if you have signal issues with your satellite unit. I have my unit placed next to the back door in the kitchen and I can hear it all over the first floor of my home.

       "This case is a veritable dirt magnet.  It attracts more lint than I ever knew existed on my desk.  However, it protects very well.  One thing I was worried about was the possibility of the hard plastic front of the case scratching my screen.  However, it doesn't even touch the ipod.  Also I worried about a loss of sensitivity for my clickwheel.  While it isn't quite as sensitive, it makes it more precise in my opinion, seeing as how I all of a sudden found myself at the end of my artists lists when I wanted in the S range without the case on.  This blue case even looks good on my black ipod, even though I was worried the color would appear muted.  It's still vibrant.  \n",
       "\n",
       "One complaint that some have already brought up is the covered hold button.  Truthfully this doesn't bother me, because I have long enough fingernails to dig in and push the button.  But those without could have a great deal of difficulty.  Also, the hole for the headset isn't quite large enough, and sometimes my headphones will pop out (I'm not using the earbuds that came with the ipod, so I do not know how those would fare).  \n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, it's a great case that you won't lose your grip on.  It protects well, and you never have to take it off, even to plug it in.  I would recommend it, though it is a bit pricy.    \n",
       "\n",
       "In a bit of an update, with this case on, my iPod survived a ferret attack, with only one little tiny puncture mark on the outside of the case.  I think this case is well worth the money.  My iPod could have been destroyed, but it's perfect\n",

       "We bought this phone and two additional handsets eleven months ago.  One handset gave us problems from the start, but was promptly replaced when returned for service.  The system works fine in our 2-story, 2,300 sq. ft. home.  I did notice some reception problems carrying the handset into the closed garage with the base station upstairs on the opposite end of the house.  As a test I took the handset down the street about 100 yards away - it still got a clear dialtone to the base located in upstairs bedroom facing the street.  I like the features, including paging system, call transfer, and handset speakerphone.  Being able to have a phone at any 110v outlet location is a big plus.  I think the sound quality is very good, and the controls well laid out and pretty intuitive.  I agree that having to enter memory numbers into each handset is a drag.\n",

The only thing that is not great about this phone is that the base and the headset each have their own memory and you will need to enter people twice-into both directories.  Oher than that, this is a GREAT phone.  I have owned panasonic and GE cordless phones in the past and had problems.  I even bought and returned 2 phones before trying and keeping this phone. \n",

True, the seller made a little on the shipping - maybe $4.50 not counting time.  Think how much Apple must be making!  The packaging didn't mention Nano so with a bit of trepidation I plugged it into the wall and my iPod and my Nano liked it!  Charging happened - it must have been made before the Nano came out.

       "I ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins.  Found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor doesn't support anyway.  Originally, the DVI-D specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal, but most manufacturer's have only used the video portion.  If you need a DVI-D cable, an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won't process the audio signal anyway.  There are a few (very few) devices that do use all 24 pins, but with the advent of HDMI, nobody really makes them anymore\n",

I don't really mind too much that the power and volume is under the desk because I have enough space down there and all I have to is lean down...  Anyway I personally feel the only way it could be better was if there was a remote for it and it gets hella loud (considering its computer speakers) I don't even have to turn them all the way up to hear them when I'm in the shower so I am pretty much happy with them\n",

       "I needed new computer speakers after my Cyber Acoustics died after only 3 months. SO i wasn't going to buy the same brand since it died so fast. I use a Mac i wanted some nice sounding speakers, but couldn't decide to go with either the Sound Sticks, Creatures, or these. Well since i am saving up for a new Laptop, i wanted to save as much money as possible. Plus me and my dad had bought this brand over 7 years ago and they STILL work and sound great so i decided to give these a chance. Well first thing i did when i got them was turn the volume up to Max and Sub base up to Max. (Yes i underestimated these speakers) When i turned a song in in iTunes i nearley got blasted out of my chair! I was supprised by the sound clarity was pretty good even at higher volume, and sub was powerful shaking my whole desk! \n",

In other words, in the 2 1/2 months since we have owned this player, quality and reliability have been high.  Price too was very reasonable.  That means durability is the last quality to consider, which is why I have given the player a 4 rather than a 5.  There is no reason a machine like this should not be problem free for years.

       "As long as I own a pair of these headphones, I will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again.  They sound PERFECT.  I cannot fathom a more balanced, natural sound.  These babies put you in the recording studio, or in the concert hall!  Bass is crisp, taut, and strong. You can feel it. Yet it is not overbearing or boomy. Midrange is balanced so well that you'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist, and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes. The folding feature is handy.\n",
       "\n",
       "The only things to be aware of are the following:  First, you have to break them in.  They start sounding better after a few hours of use.  Second, they don't have an inline volume control, which I will dearly miss from my Koss KTXpro1s.  Finally, plenty of sound escapes.  So don't crank them too much in the library or at Grandma Edith's funeral.  \n",

It comes on when the power is on and goes off as soon as I turn off the unit.  Has anyone experienced this with theirs?  My first generation nano does not experience this noise.

       "I have never been a fan of the Ipod. I have been an Iriver H120, H320, and H340 owner. I had a Toshiba Gigabeat and currently own an Archos AV500. The reason for owning a Nano is because of the size of the AV500. It is too big to pack around unless I am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on. The Nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote, (soon), I am very happy with it. It loads from Itunes very easily and I have had no problems with it not playing certain files, (and I would reencode them if there was a problem.) Apple, don't let me down\n",

       "The KOSS Pro-4AA's were not made for iPod/MP3 headphone users.  TO begin with, they reveal the low fidelity of MP3 files (compared with LP's or CD's).  Also, they require a 1/4\"-to-3.5mm (or other) adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment.\n",
       "\n",
       "These Headphones have been around a long time. Check out the old photos of the \"Watergate\" hearings from 1973/1974, and notice that the Senators &amp; attorneys were all listening through KOSS Pro 4AA headphones.  Their longevity is mainly due to their extermely high fidelity audio reproduction. Unfortunately, their age has made them somewhat inconvenient for most listeners, since they are very heavy and a bit cumbersome.\n",
       "\n",
       "NEGATIVES:\n",
       "1) Weight (about 3 or 4 times as heavy as most contemporary studio-reference headphones)\n",
       "2) Tight headband - as noted, the fit is fatiguing if your 'hat size' is greater than 7 1/2.\n",
       "3) The coiled cord is extremely difficult to replace (it's actually less expensive to replace the entire set of headphones of you can get a good discount).\n",
       "\n",
       "POSITIVES:\n",
       "1) AUDIO FIDELITY. Unless you want to spend at least $300 for a set of headphones, the sound quality and fidelity of the Pro-4AA's is almost impossible to beat.\n",
       "2) VALUE. As noted above, for the price you pay, these are vastly superior to any other headphones that are comparably priced.\n",
       "3) DURABLE. My first pair lasted 30 years.  They were dropped and knocked around, and finally gave out when (It think) a voltage spike surged in the left earphone, fusing a coil.\n",
       "4) ISOLATION. THe paddded earphones block out external sound very well.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sound fidelity is preserved over a wide volume range. These sound great at low and high volumes.\n",
       "\n",
       "The biggest Positive (and the reason why I prefer to use Pro-4AA's for audio mixing, other studio applications, and serious listeining) is that they are extremely unlikely to be stolen.  Size matters: they are heavy, and bulky so they're not easily concealed; and since iPOD or MP3 players use the mini plugs, these require additional hardware.  If you just want 'jogging/exercise music', then these will not work well. If you want hi-fidelity at a bargain price, the Pro-4AA's are still the best choice around.\n",

My only problem is that at times, I will turn off the mouse by attaching the receiver to the bottom, but it won't seem to turn off! I reset the mouse and then attach the receiver again, and this always does the trick. Other than that, very ergonomic, extremely smooth and precise.\n",

Having to disassemble the unit to place it back in the box required the base stand to be taken apart but that was next to impossible without breaking it. Suffice to say, quality control missed this one.\n",

The built-in speakers leave less than desired and useless. \n",

Then I bought the Lowrance but it was too heavy and the mount was a sgood as the Cobra. I returned the Lowrance and bought the Garmin 340.\n",

The traffic service is also nice (costs more with the Garmin).  The Cobra is the most capable of the GPS units I mentioned but overall I am happier with the Garmin because of it's smaller size and lower price\n",

I am very impressed with the GPS, but the mount used to attach the unit to the window or dash is very poorly designed.  The unit falls off the window and from the dash, plus the power cord comes out too easily.  The unit deserves a five star rating, but because of the mounting system and power cord coming out too easily a four star rating was provided.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Cobra's NAV ONE 4500 and Garmin's StreetPilot 2720, which each sell for $800 to $1,000, use a more straightforward approach. The traffic info travels along with FM radio broadcasts from Clear Channel stations in 48 of the top 50 markets. An FM antenna and receiver pick it off the air and feed it to the navigation system.\"\n",

       "\"I preferred the Cobra, mostly for its big, bright 5-inch screen and its built-in radio receiver. (The Garmin receiver is $200 extra and needs to be installed between your car antenna and radio.) When you encounter traffic, a pop-up on the screen and a voice give you three options: Keep driving, reroute me, or give me a couple of new routes and let me pick one.\n",

       "\n",
       "Pros:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Comfortable to wear. The ear cushions are indeed comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Even if you wear glasses, you won't feel uncomfortable.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Clear treble, middle, and bass. You can hear all the subtle sounds in your song clearly. Even with completely flat EQ setting, the headset does very good job with sound (provided you increase the volume up a bit more). As with any headphones, take time to 'break it in' to have it function the best it can (it means, to leave music playing on the headphone for very extended period of time non-stop, about 24 or 32 hours).\n",
       "\n",
       "- Sturdy wires. This headphone seems to have been designed based on recording studio-level headphones in this regard. The wire is very thick and long. Also, it's single wire format.\n",
       "\n",
       "Cons:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Ear padding is perhaps, too soft. This means it won't fully cover your ear area, and some of sound may leak out. So note that when you listen to your music loud in public places. Although, at first few weeks, the ear padding is relatively hard. If you are looking for a headphone that will ensure your music will never leak out, look into getting in-ear canal type headphones instead.\n",
       "\n",
       "- As some others have pointed out, tilting your head too forward or backward will make your headphone just drop from where it is at. So be cautious of your movements.\n",
       "\n",
       "- You might not want to wear this kind of headphone during summer due to poor ventilation. But this affects all closed headphones, so it's not a huge negative point.\n",
       "\n",
       "- The headphone is quite big and on a small head, you may have a difficult time keeping it up on your head. The size of the headphone is designed for a fully grown average adult head.\n",
       "\n",
       "That's all I've got to say, and overall, this headset is definitely worth your money\n",

       "I was unsure at first if this product would work with my iPod nano, but after checking out Griffin's website, I decided to go ahead and order it.  It works great!  I like to play Solitaire and read text files on my nano, so the battery charge runs down much faster than it would if I didn't use the screen so much.  TuneJuice means I don't ever have to worry about that again.  I just keep a couple of 9V batteries with me, and I can keep listening, playing, reading or whatever on my nano as long as I want.  Love it.\n",
       "-------\n",
       "I posted the above review on May 22, 2006 after having had the TuneJuice for almost 3 weeks.  Two of those weeks were spent on vacation and this little gadget got a *lot* of use.  \n",
       "\n",
       "Now, about 5 months after first receiving the TuneJuice, I'm about to order my second one - to replace the first one.  I still love it, and did get a *lot* of use out of it, but snapping 9V batteries on and off so many times caused the wires leading from inside the battery compartment to the 'snaps' that connect to the battery itself to break off. Despite that, I feel like I got my money's worth and I'm buying another one\n",

I have a Yamaha RX-V2700 receiver which has HDMI hookups.  I tried a HDMI cable that came with my DirecTV box (from my Toshiba HD DVD player) and it was seriously lacking. This hookup is MUCH better!  I have a Monster Cable HDMI hooked up to the new receiver that runs to my Sony 46\" flat panel as well (more $ but....).  I'm finally satisfied.  I'm watching (and listening to) \"Batman Begins\" (In True HD sound) on HD DVD and it is superb!!!!  This is just awesome!  The stuff of fantasy.  You only have to buy this/these cables once, so why not buy the BEST?!  I highly recommend this move. \n",

I am using this mouse on a laptop and love how inobtrusive it is.\n",

It only fits the hand the same but once you move it, it lacks the same comfort and ease of use as this mouse\n",

       "I bought these Ear Headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club. The sound quality is acceptable, not exceptional. The construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right. That places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out. I have no idea why Sony thought that this was a good design. For the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord. I would give these a B- good/not great\n",

       "I bought this to replace the corded version of the same item. The cordless works as well as the corded one. The trackball doesn't has quite as smooth a roll to it as the corded one did, but the difference is minimal. I wonder if this may be because it is new and the other one had had years of use.\n",

       "- I initially had the receivers out of sight behing an LCD monitor. I found that it was necessary to move them away from the monitor to get them to work reliably. This is a documented requirement in the owners manual, but that necessity takes away from the convenience of the wireless. The receivers, as stated earlier, take up space I would rather not spare\n",

       "We have a TrackMan corded model and loved it so I got this one for my work computer.  It works just as well as the corded one when I'm in my office.  For travel, the part you plug in is a little bulky so I usually leave it at home when I travel.  It's not a small, USB stick that goes in the back.  It's a long, corded, mouse looking device that sends/recieves the signal to the TrackMan.  I don't think they market it as a portable device so it works just as advertised but it would be nice if it just had a USB stick instead of the other for travel.  All that said, I love the trackball over a mouse so this is just perfect for me\n",

       "If you buy this service plan, print out the contract and keep your receipt. I did not purchase the plan, but looked over the contract intensely since I nearly got it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some notes on the contract:\n",
       "1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\n",
       "2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\n",
       "3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\n",
       "4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\n",
       "5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\n",
       "6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don't cover accidents and they don't cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN'T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don't hold me liable since I don't have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.\n",
       "\n",
       "Assuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn't get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)\n",

       "We used the GTX600VP4 to stay in contact with two vehicles while traveling. The 5-watt power gave us ample range. Does it reach 18 or 20 miles, don't know.  But 5 to 8 miles between cars was not a problem. Range was somewhat reduced over hilly terrain and varied from poor to good in the Rocky Mountains. It's a great way to stay in touch when traveling. The batteries are rechargeable, both A/C &amp; D/C. The ear pieces were very good for privacy. Very easy to use and well worth the price. A good investment.\n",

       "I was hesitant to get this, since other reviewers gave it poor ratings on reception.  Now that I bought it, I'm very glad I have it.  It does all the things you might want in a disaster, inluding a flashlight, red flashing light (especially if your car breaks down at night), a siren (if you're trapped in a building), AC, battery, and crank power, and multiple radio bands.  While some reviewers complained of not getting a lot of stations, in a disaster, you only need a few stations, as everyone will be broadcasting disaster news.  Between the AM, FM, TV, and NOAA bands, my radio will received a huge number of stations--many more than would ever be needed in a disaster.  (I didn't try the cellphone charging function.)  It comes in a carrying case.\n",
       "Only minor criticisms:  The case seems like an afterthought:  it doesn't hold the AC adapter; the knobs tend to turn the radio on when putting it in the case, and the knobs could get broken off if the case is hit (not that protective). However, it comes in a strong box which is perhaps better storage for everything.\n",
       "Overall, this is all you should need for light, siren, and broadcast information from multiple power sources in a disaster\n",

The service was excellent and the cable arrived in 4 days! I highly recommend this cable. I just plugged it into my cable box and the other end into the TV and WOW what a great picture all around.

       "The SanDisk 1GB Micro SD Card arrived quickly with intact sturdy packaging.  I installed it in my Motorala RAZR V3m as expanded memory for my music library.  Be sure to remove the RAZR battery to clear the access slot for the Micro SD.  The V3m recognized the expanded memory without any problems.  I used Motorola Phone Tools to transfer my entire music library.  The program converts the mp3 file formats before transfer. The entire music library...a full 1GB...transferred reasonably quickly.  The V3m is slow to access \"My Music\" using menu function #3 under \"Get Tunes &amp; Tones\".  Function #6 \"Manage Music\" accesses the library reasonably quickly and works well.  The new corded Motorola SYN1301B stereo earbuds work well in this configuration.  Sound quality is surprisingly good, but the large diameter earbuds are flat...not tapered... and do not seat very well in the ear canal.  The SanDisk 1GB MicroSD Card provides great value at a very reasonable price for full optimization of the V3m as cell phone with \"MP3\" player\n",

       "Okay so it was about 8:45 at night. I was coming on to a 1/2 mile long bridge that goes over a lake where I live. I was doing 60mph, the speed limit is 40. As I start to approach the bridge I start getting a small K-Band warning. I instantly slow down to the speed limit. As I start crossing the bridge the warning keeps increasing so I slow down even more to 35 mph. Then it gets to full K-Band. I look to my left where there is a service parking area, and in the pitch dark I see the reflectors of the one and only Crown Vic Police Car. As I pass the police car, I start flashing all the oncoming cars to tell them that there is a cop ahead.  \n",

       "This is my second Escort Passport 8500 X50. The first one is in another car. It saved me many times for getting caught though I'm not maniac driver. The detection range is very good, it gives you plenty time to adjust your speed before you see the police car. I love the blue color and it only costs $30 more than red. The only problem that I have experienced on my first one is sometimes I got laser false warning signals, especially on raining day with defog is on. I heard someone mentioned that turbo charged car can causes X50 Pop and Laser false warning signals, and my first X50 is in my turbo charged car. I'm not sure if Pop alerts were false but since it won't help much, I have it turned off. Overall, it's very good detector, you will get payback if you own one. \n",

       "I got mine to work in about 30 min following S Huffs directions below (followed exactly).  There was only one thing not mentioned that I had to do to get it to work.  Once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable WEP and put in the key and passphrase, I had to turn WEP back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender.  Basically just put step 6 before you save settings in step 5, this is what worked for me at any rate.\n",

       "1-Disable WEP on your Router or AP \n",
       "2-Hold the auto-configuration button for 30 seconds(if everything goes well both lights on the expander will turn blue) and unplug while still holding button. Plug back in after 10-15 secs. \n",
       "3-open your Internet explorer browser and type 192.168.1.240 (default ip of expander), a window will pop up. leave the user name blank and put admin as a password (this is default password). \n",
       "4-make sure that the default gateway and subnet mask settings are identical with your Router or AP,change password on the expander if desired &amp; save settings. (all settings should be correct due to auto configuration) \n",
       "5-Enable WEP on the expander, once again remember use same settings that you will be putting in your router or AP in step 6 -- aka same passphrase), save settings again. \n",
       "5.5 - As soon as you enable WEP on your expander - you will loose your connection to it as it's now setup for WEP and your router isn't - keep this in mind - drove me nuts. \n",
       "6-Go to your Router or Ap settings and enable WEP. \n",
       "7 - UNPLUG your expander for 10 to 15 seconds and plug it back in -- Bang you're DONE. Enjoy \n",

I also like the feature of the intercom feature.  My daughter has one of the handsets downstairs in her room and if she isn't on the phone, I can contact her to talk to her.  \n",

So far... WOW!!! its worked out great. The phone is also good by itself, plus it was inexpensive through AMAZON. For anyone interested in going the route I took... you will not be disappointed. \n",

       "I have had this TV since Mid-March 2006. I absolutley love it!! I did extensive research before I bought a large screen TV and found that this Samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck. I read some reviews saying that DLP technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect, especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action. One reviewer specifically said to try playing \"Bourne Supremecy\" to see an example of the rainbow effect. This was the first dvd I played on this tv and I did not once have a problem with rainbow effect. Overall I have no complaints with this TV. Samsung has produced an excellent product. I recommend either satellite or HD programming for the best picture. Regular cable comes in sort of grainy.\n",
       "As far as where to buy it, I recommend Best Buy. I originally was going to buy from Amazon because when I first looked they were offering free shipping. When I decided to buy their was no longer free shipping, so off to Best Buy I went where they price matched me with amazon's price no questions asked. Best Buy offers an extended warranty for around $400 that covers bulb replacement or any other problems. It will also cover the rainbow effect on the slight chance that you have any problem with it. Overall a wonderful product\n",

       "I bought a pair of Sony MDR-XD100's (they are full cup headphones) because I lost the earbuds which came with my mp3 player (Sony HD5). I took them out of the package and found that, even at full volume on the player, it cannot drive the headphones sufficently. I went to a few electronics stores then found the KOSS EQ50.\n",

       "On with the review:\n",
       "\n",
       "Yes, there is a slight hiss, but I find it alright. The biggest gripe I have is that whenever someone within about 2-3 ft (IE, on a bus or subway) uses a cellphone, this devices picks it up. You can get the same effect by using a cellphone next to an unshielded pair or speakers. I do most of my listening at home so this won't bo too much of an issue.\n",
       "\n",
       "It also does a great job of amplifying the signal, it works very well, I can now listen to my XD100's properly (and they are very good!). I haven't used the EQ much but what I can say is that it is very, very sensitive. Raising the bass slider a third above normal makes a massive difference. At a half, my headphones start to distort.\n",
       "\n",
       "If your looking for a nice little EQ and/or preamp this is the product for you. It has its drawbacks though, mainly the problem with cellphone interference and of course, the hiss but it isn't too loud &amp; I can live with it.\n",
       "\n",
       "I reccomend this product if your looking for a budget portable equalizer or headphone amplifer\n",

       "I picked up 4 pairs of these on Amazon, and have applied the CA and Nylon tape fix to the first pair (took about 10 minutes to do, let it cure overnight).  Headphones look ok, with just the right amount of Geekhood proudly announced afterwards (reminiscent of the last generation of Geeks with the tape on the glasses).  Sound is very good (better than most earbuds), they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated Logitech transiever, and range is outstanding.  My only beef is how long I have to hold down the power switch to turn them on, and so far I have not successfully established a connections with my Treo 650.  1 star held back because of need of customer applied ECO, and they are only partially functional with the Nano (can't use the advance track feature of the headphones)\n",

Eagle arrived 10 days earlier than the Amazon estimate, unloaded the TV right to the TV stand, and after hooking it up and making sure the controls worked and the picture / sound worked, I signed for it.  And, Eagle asked if I wanted the packaging carted away.\n",

But it doesn't effect the enjoyment since I purchased this for the HD, and it blows me away.\n",

       "It is remarkable that, even though there are hundreds of iPod cases in existence, none of them are near-perfect.  I tried four different cases, both hard plastic and silicone variants, and the iskin case comes the closest, protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use.\n",
       "\n",
       "The case is basically a hybrid of hard plastic and soft silicone.  The ipod first slips into a silicone sleeve, which covers every part of the ipod except for the earphone plug and the screen.  In addition, there is a hard plastic plate that is then inserted into seems on the front of the silicone case, and this provides the screen protection.  Due to the double-seam in the silicone, the plastic plate never comes in contact with the ipod, so you don't have to worry about it scratching.\n",
       "\n",
       "The case even has a flap that covers the dock connector, preventing dust from entering, yet you can still use the universal dock without removing the case.\n",
       "\n",
       "The most unique part of this case is that it covers the clickwheel, but the silicone is so thin that it hardly impedes the scrolling.  Actually, I think it provides just enough resistance so that you will overshoot your target much less than with the bare clickwheel.\n",
       "\n",
       "The only real downside I found with the iskin is the clip that comes with it--I would not trust it at all, so I took it off.  It would be nice to have a better clip that you can actually use, and it would be really great to have an armband available for it as well, but as I said above, I have yet to find a perfect ipod case.  Like most silicone cases, this one does also attract lint in your pockets, etc., but it is not as bad as other cases.\n",
       "\n",
       "Unfortunately, even though this is a great case, it is not readily available.  I couldn't find it in any store, and Amazon only sells it through Marketplace sellers.  I ordered from Applelinks, and they delivered it to me in four days.  Whatever you do, don't order from the iSkin company directly.  I have heard countless horror stories of people waiting a month for their cases.  They should re-dedicate themselves to manufacturing these great iskins and let others worry about selling them\n",

       "I tried both Microsoft's LifeCam VX-3000 and VX-6000. Had 'em both home and ran trials with my Intel Pentium D Dual Core 3.00GHz CPU with 2 gigs of ram and, with both of those, the video lagged the audio (distractingly so). Spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly Microsoft customer service rep one evening (got through on their toll free line)and he pointed me to new software for the VX-6000. Downloaded the 50 meg plus file, installed it, but the VX-6000 still produced out-of-sync video vs. audio when I created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on Media Player or editing in Windows Movie Maker. \n",
       "\n",
       "So, I talked to some technicians at our company and then talked to the webcam guru at the local assembler that built my, I believe, excellent computer. All recommended Logitech when buying webcams. I then marched back to Best Buy and traded my $99 Microsoft VX-6000 for a Logitech Quickcam Orbit MP for BB's price of $139.95. You can find this Logitech unit cheaper all over the place, including, of course, here at Amazon. The package I bought included an inexpensive headset, which I haven't used so far.\n",
       "\n",
       "Although I haven't tried the Orbit in a video phone call yet, from the moment I turned it on I had that satisfing good feeling that I bought a winner. Installed fairly easily with a couple of bumps. Got a \"USB composite device has not passed Windows Logo testing\" screen a couple of times..BUT..I received the SAME screen on, get this, the Microsoft cams! I just continued installing and have not experienced system problems so far.\n",
       "\n",
       "The audio sync with video in making a recording is right on (remember, that was primary reason for taking back the Microsoft cameras) AND the picture clarity on my LCD flat panel monitor at the 640 webcam capture setting produced a gorgeous picture. Excellent detail and smoothness of video. Besides the superior audio sync with video, the Orbit MP is remarkably better than the VX-6000 and way above the $49 Microsoft VX-3000 in all other criteria too, in my opinion after comparison testing.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Orbit's special effects are interesting and fun. The pan, tilt, etc., excellent. The face tracking is vigorous and alive - fun to watch the little Orbit camera turn - but I haven't tested in actual live conferencing yet.\n",
       "\n",
       "All in all - for webcams, I'm now saying what more experienced webcam users told me - head for Logitech. They've certianly hooked me with their apparent superior performance. The Orbit MP is a keeper! Not going to waste anymore time searching and testing. And, my advice to Microsoft, you'd better talk to the outfit that bought your name for those Lifecams. I've relied on the Microsoft name on peripherals, keyboards, etc., and I've generally been very satisfied. But, in webcams, with me, the Microsoft brand now takes a back seat to Logitech.\n",

       "\n",
       "I'm very pleased with my little iQue M5 GPS/PDA.  While it's not perfect, it's pretty darn amazing. I had actually purchased a Lowrence iWay 350 GPS, but then my husband discovered the iQue on sale at Costco for about [...] more.  With the iQue offering so many more features, I returned the Lowrence and purchased the iQue.  With my husband and I both having the same machines, we can beam information to each other or send them over Bluetooth.\n",
       "\n",
       "It has taken many hours of playing around with it to get to learn the device, as it isn't very intuitive and the manuals, especially for the PDA, are limited. My husband has spent a lot of time learning to use the GPS, and he's learning its idiosyncrasies as far as planning routes and getting it to avoid routing through construction areas.  It's very sophisticated and the maps are great - better detail than the Lowrence.  We purchased a 2 Gig memory card and downloaded the entire map database onto it, and there were still 300 gigs to spare.  I had no trouble downloading the maps or the Active Sync software.  The basic GPS functions are easy to use once you get the hang of it, the voice directions are clear and concise, and it re-routes quickly if you go off course.  You can plan your route in advance without having the GPS activated.  This is a good idea, since it can take up to 5 minutes for the unit to locate the satellites, and you can be on your way if you've viewed your route before starting out.\n",
       "\n",
       "I used the GPS on a trip Stratford, Canada, and it was wonderful having the Canadian maps as well as the US maps available. I even used it handheld while walking to my bed-and-breakfast from the theater.  Every once in awhile there is a glitch (it said the theater was on the left, which would have taken me into the Avon River!), but it's generally right on target and I find most of the problems are operator error, such as turning too soon. The \"Route to Home\" feature is very convenient. Granted, the iQue doesn't always take you on the shortest route, but it will get you where you're going and if you're \"directionally challenged\" like I am, it becomes indispensible.\n",
       "\n",
       "The car mounting bracket works fine.  It's popped off occasionally in hot weather, but generally stays put. The bracket would be easy to move to another vehicle.  The GPS would work in a cup-holder if you needed to use it in a rental car.\n",
       "\n",
       "I've spent more time learning the PDA portion, which uses Windows Mobile 2003 2nd Edition. The iQue uses Outlook as its interface, so you'll have to have it installed on your computer. Not having used Outlook before, I installed Outlook on my laptop and spent some time getting familiar with it, which was helpful.  \n",
       "\n",
       "The PDA has so many functions that it's hard to even describe what this little machine can do.  It will organize all of your calendar functions and contacts, checks e-mail, accesses the Internet if you get a Wi-Fi card, recognizes handwriting, has a voice recorder, interfaces with other Bluetooth units, sends alarms, has Word and Excel, even has a couple of good games.  I got a separate SD card for music and downloaded a lot of songs, and the sound through headphones is quite acceptable (it has bass boost).  It uses Windows Media Player so you can organize all of your playlists.  You can download any programs that are available for Windows Mobile 2003, including TV shows and videos.  I never thought I'd find much use for a PDA but I'm using it every day.  No more little notes on scraps of paper or a separate pocket calendar, address book or even an IPod.  Everything is in one handy-dandy little machine. And even though it isn't that intuitive, once you've learned the basic conventions they translate to most of the programs.\n",
       "\n",
       "We've called Garmin Tech Support a few times and, although they are only open during regular business hours, we found American staff who are very knowledgeable about the product.  Since a good GPS will run at least [...], this was a great bargain at around [...]  We've purchased screen protectors and are hoping it won't wear out too quickly, as I've heard Palm Pilots tend to do.  I'm really enjoying the iQue.\n",

At times, it was a help (like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in VA and we needed an alternate route).

       "Not much said about the fantastic quality of the video picture. You wouldn't think that you would actually be able to watch video on a screen this small but the resolution and quality of the picture is amazing. I have shown it to an I-Pod owner and was told the video on this player is definately better than the I-Pod.\n",
       "The unit is not perfect, it does freeze occasionally, but the re-set function has always unlocked it. The video sometimes converts in a jerky fashion also. But the conversion software was able to handle very large files. I suspect a little tweaking might fix the conversions.\n",
       "Sound quality is great. Combine this with Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds and you'll love it.\n",
       "This is my forth MP3 type player amd the extra money over the lower end players definately yields a better product. The previous player, Creative Zen Nano Plus 1 GB MP3, quit working the week the warranty ran out.\n",

Anyways, this is an excellent monitor with excellent color reproduction and response times (more than enough for my flight sims). Movies are beautiful and the rather weird resolution hasn't been a problem. The design is probably the neatest looking out there (subjective I realize). The ONLY gripe I have w/ this monitor is lack of swivel (sigh). Other than that I'm very pleased with everything about this screen\n",

       "My favorite thing about this phone is that the caller ID captures 11 digit numbers (1-xxx-xxx-xxxx) which are then very easy to store into the phone book and call.  My old phone only captured 10 digits (xxx-xxx-xxxx) which meant I had to reenter everything manually because of course you have to dial a 1 first.  This new phone also allows me to toggle between 11 digits and 7 digits on the same number.  I put together my phone book just by capturing calls as they came in.  Very handy.  As far as being a phone, it does everything well and after a couple of months I am still as happy as could be with it\n",

I received this e260 4 GB MP3 player for my birthday in June 2006, and this is the first MP3 player I have ever owned.  Although there are a few little quirks, overall I am not disappointed and would recommend this MP3 player.\n",

       "I installed the software on my computer, and the disk is where you will find the owner's manual.  I was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner's manual, and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my MP3 player froze and I had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide (turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it). \n",

Although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices, I decided to leave them on there until I need the space.  About three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months.  I currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more.\n",
       "\n",
       "As far as performance goes, it performs pretty well.  The buttons are a little difficult to get used to, as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel.  Not too bad, but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there, you will be scrolling a lot.  \n",
       "\n",
       "I do not use all the functions that came with this MP3 player.  It has music, fm radio, photo, voice, video and a settings option.  I have used the music function and the voice recorder option, both with good results.  The only downside to the voice recorder is that you can't get the recordings you made off the MP3 player and onto your computer.  It would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer.  As for syncing music files, I have not had any problems, although I did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded, but when you try to play it, it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list.  I don't know what caused this.  Also, you can only store a song as one genre, which is a little annoying.  Be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the MP3 player, you cannot change the genre.\n",

       "It came with a headset, but I have never used it.  Instead I purchased some Panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it.  \n",

       "I do wish the MP3 player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer's USB drive to charge.  Another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen.  I can't remember it being dropped or anything, so I don't know what caused this, but it's pretty noticeable.  It doesn't seem to affect the operation, just the aesthetics.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, the cons are little irritations to me and I would recommend this player to someone who doesn't want an iPod\n",

       "I'm a skeptic. No, I mean I'm REALLY a skeptic... especially in today's marketplace (because nothing is built like it used to be). I don't buy anything without checking it out first, and even then, I expect that it's probably going to fail me when I do. Yeah, wonderful view there, huh?\n",
       "\n",
       "Well, needless to say, I was pleasantly (and quite happily) surprised when this device didn't fail me out of the box. I've been using my speedpad for almost a year now, and I have to say that it has been by far more solid, responsive and intuitive than I ever expected it to be. I will not play a PC game without it plugged in now, that's how well this gamepad has worked for me.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here are the ins and outs:\n",
       "\n",
       "1) Solid construction. As others have stated, this device feels very solid and is just generally \"sturdy as hell\". This, alone, surprised me. Not too many electronic devices are solidly made these days (not too many at all!)... so I'm glad to see that this one was. Belkin did an excellent job in this department.\n",
       "\n",
       "2) Software. Do yourself a favor, when you get this device home, don't bother putting in the CD that comes with it. Instead, go directly to Belkin's website first-thing, download the newer version of the software (which is near exactly the same as what's on the CD, but updated) and install that *before* plugging in your speedpad for the first time. Do that and you'll have everything updated immediately with little to no trouble at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "I've had no problems with the software for this hardware (and that's generally the part I have trouble with the most). The applications (profiler and button editor) function perfectly, and macros are a snap to program. Kudos to Belkin's programmers on writing the software suite for this, they did a good job.\n",
       "\n",
       "4) Sticky keys. Most people have experienced this.. myself included. Being possibly a byproduct of the solid construction of the product, basically, what happens is the keys stick just a little bit coming out of the box. Though just \"excercising\" the device (pressing the buttons down quickly and solidly over and over) for a few seconds after plugging it in each time I went to use it cleared up this issue within the first week of using the gamepad, and I've never had it happen since. \n",
       "\n",
       "5) Other buttons. \n",
       "* The mouse scroll wheel can be an annoyance, and I don't use it much at all because it's hard to scroll up and down with it (Belkin may just have made that particular button a little *too* solid). \n",
       "* The orange button above the d-pad also isn't that easy to press, though if you keep you pinky finger positioned on the side of the keypad for leverage, it's not impossible to press this button (in fact, I use it as my default \"map\" button in most of the games I play). It's perfect for those functions you use enough to need a button for but not enough to need an easy spam button.\n",
       "* I haven't experienced any problems hitting the 'space' button below the d-pad that others have experienced. My thumb taps that button as easily as it taps the space bar on a standard keyboard. My only complaint with it is that I can't simply twist my thumb a bit to hit the key, I have to actually lift my thumb off the d-pad to do it - and that's not much of a complaint at all, really.\n",
       "\n",
       "The d-pad itself is a godsend! I'm a true console gamer, having used nothing but d-pads for movement since all the time spent playing my old NES as a kid (and using a joystick before that with my even older Atari). D-pad is all I know, really. In fact, the one thing that's kept me away from PC gaming all these years is I've never, ever been able to accustom myself to using arrow keys or WASD for movement (and probably never will get accustomed to that either). For the longest time I was looking for a device that could allow me to keep the sensitivity of mouse aiming (to keep up with other PC players) while giving me an actual d-pad for movement... and that is EXACTLY what this gamepad did for me. \n",
       "\n",
       "As I said at the top of this review, I will never play a PC game without my Nostromo speedpad plugged in. This gamepad has provided the one benefit that other pads haven't and that I really needed - a controller interface that's actually functional and intuitive enough to use that I forget I'm using it most of the time, allowing me to immerse myself completely in whatever game I'm playing... which is really the point of gaming in the first place, isn't it? \n",
       "\n",
       "The Nostromo Speedpad gets 5 stars from me. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for the type of benefits I've listed. And, for that matter, I'm recommending it right now in fact...\n",

Garmin's external antenna connector plug does not attach very firmly and can disconnect easily when the units are moved around (on my GPS).  I feel the antenna was worth purchasing\n",

       "Since there are very few cases that fit iPAQ PDAs, I recommend you get this one.  Depending on type of your iPAQ (1900 series vs 3000 series), you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your PDA into the case.  Once you're done, however, it's very easy to use and carry.  It comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use.  The case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket, unlike so many other cases.  The obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface, this case won't provide much in a way of side protection (klutzes be warned).  The leather feels surprisingly good, almost a lambskin kind of quality.  The credit card space is not very useful, but you can shove a couple of business cards in there. A solid 4 stars until anything better becomes available\n",

I like that it's not huge and doesn't have all those extra ridiculous buttons that I never use. The rechargeable mouse is handy as well. Prior to this, I had two Microsoft wireless combos in a row, and in both cases the mouse gradually began flaking out on me. I don't know if it's because it's Logitech or it's bluetooth, but the keyboard/mouse are as responsive as were they wired (after they \"wake up\").\n",

The main charging station is about 40 feet away at the opposite end of the house from my farthest charger, with a couple walls in between, and I have no problems with signal.\n",

       "Would have been great if they'd included a headset that goes with it since the handsets do have headset jacks.  I love the extra handsets that only need to be plugged into a power outlet - solved my lack of working jacks problem!!\n",

       "The display lights up when it rings and when you press any of the keys.  The keys are not backlit.  The menus are fairly intuitive - if you've ever had a cell phone you can figure this out pretty easily.  It's very easy to send phone numbers that you've programmed into one handset to all the other handsets or only to a specific handset.\n",
       "\n",
       "When I first hooked everything up, the phones got no dial tone, but the problem was with the phone cord that plugs into the phone jack in the wall.  For some reason, the cord they provided didn't work, so when I swapped it out with the cord I had, all the phones worked fine.\n",

       "This is definitely a comfortable mouse if you don't have big hands. It is a pretty small mouse but it contours very nicely, even if you are left-handed. The extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who don't like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward, backward, and switch between programs. The button in the middle though (the one that lets you switch programs) is out of the way. It takes just a bit more effort to use, meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button. I actually hardly ever use that button. I can't live without the forward/backward buttons though. I find myself man-handling other mice thinking they too have those neat, little buttons. The mouse has a really good response to movement as well. I've used it for gaming as well, though I admit I'm not a hardcore gamer. I really recommend this mouse. I can't imagine spending more money and getting a remarkably better mouse than this one\n",

       "This is an excellent product. If you drive a delivery vehicle or are in route sales this product is for you.  I am in route sales and use my laptop every minute of the day. I have an extensive territory and found it difficult to find certain places. The Garmin GPS 18 plugs right into the USB port and is powered by the computer so no need for additional attachments.  I'll admit \"NROUTE\" took a little getting used to (for example it has a list of all the streets and names of places so if it isnt on the list you're not going to find it) but once you figure out how it works its easy as pie.  Instead of spelling Hoover Street you just type Hoover and it will give you a list of the possible locations.  A great buy for only 100 bucks! If you use a laptop in your vehicle and are in need of GPS, dont spend $500 on a 2 inch screen unit when you can get an awesome GPS sensor for only $100\n",

The artifact is a vertical line which bisects the picture and offsets each side by a few pixels.  They're not really noticeable to the naked eye and you won't see them unless you're editing the picture and have blown it up considerably.  Still, it's probably not the best for archiving your photos. (I expect there's a bur on the plastic gear that rolls down the rack &amp; pinion)\n",

       "I have the Canon MP500 printer and Canon Rebel XT camera - both capable of producing amazing results, but paper makes a HUUUUGE diference in photo printing. I have both the Canon Photo Plus Glossy and the Photo Pro papers. If you are looking to print out very impressive photos, then I would recommend getting the 8x10 Photo Plus Glossy - definitely nice enough to frame. And with Plus glossy, you're definitely saving $ instead of paying $$$ to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store. And I even scanned a professional photo that I had done last year with my MP500 and printed using Plus Glossy, and the print is significantly better than the original. \n",

Like most printers, the output is much better when using the manufacture's own paper (as opposed to the cheaper generic paper), but there is no need to buy the most expensive \"Pro\" paper as neither I nor my wife could discern ANY difference between the two. There may be a benifit to the \"Pro\" paper that cannot be seen (lasts longer?) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it - this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your Canon printer (I think they look better than the ones I get from the photo lab)\n",

My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed, too.  It's not my burner (as another reviewer suggested, implying that people should learn to read), as it's brand new and doesn't require the firmware upgrade they mention. They just suck and have a high failure rate.  So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best. I'm buying some now and save myself the frustration\n",

More often than not I'll discover while watching my movies just how horrid the quality it.  My movies will skip, stutter, or stop all together.  So disappointing!

       "Well, the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it.  I need disc binders and the Case Logic brand, while being the original, is pricey.  Low cost alternatives are needed, but not at the expense of quality and TCO (total cost of ownership).  But the flap about poor customer service (rebates) and poor quality (zippers and sleeve binding) is enough to give me pause.....  So, if someone from Xtreme's management is paying attention....fix it or be content to lose business.  Price isn't everything to everyone in the markt for your product..\n",

       "I purchased dvd express and it never worked. I spent endless time with tech support. The old story about, \"It must be your computer.\" did not fly either, my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ADS. I exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before I got it. Same problems. Tech support told me I was the only person having trouble with this product. They need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones. My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and money. ADS also told me it would not work with Ulead's Movie Factory 3, some of the software it came bundled with, but that was Uleads problem. I should use Cap Wiz ( Their program ) DUH!!! Guess what, it did not work with their program either. Ulead said they had several complaints with ADS's product. Their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work. Save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product! P.S. Since ADS doesn't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade. I don't think they want a product like that either. The only reason I gave one star is.....it was packed well.\n",

       "In the ten minutes since I've had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off.  More importantly, It can't handle large manuals as advertised.  (The reason I purchased this particular book holder)  My 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter.  Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages.  If you don't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on, keep an eye on the page retainers (these are the parts that fell off) and you should be ok.  As for me, I'm off to read Amazon's return policy and see if I can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic\n",

       "I am the type of person that ALWAYS buys the extra warranty on whatever I purchase.  However, I started reading the reviews on this company and many people reported that it was four weeks and counting and they still hadn't received their refund check.  I was astonished.  I contacted N.E.W. myself and asked them about this.  With no shame or embarrassment on the part of the customer service reps, I was informed that if I did everything by email, it would take AT LEAST 15 business days (that's three weeks!) to receive my refund check AFTER I sent them the warrantied item.  If I had them send me a pre-paid label for the defective item instead of using my own printer, it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item.  In other words, it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks!  I cancelled the contract immediately.  It is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract.  I would recommend buying a product from a company that first makes a quality product and then back it up with a good warranty and gives good customer service such as Grado, Sennheiser or Koss.  But stay away from these people; that's my feeling and my advice. \n",

Upon setting everything up, it all worked great for about two hours... then the dreaded \"UNPLUG/PROTECT\" screen came up. Now it won't turn on but for a few moments before returning to protect mode. (and no, it's not a short in the wires or overheating... it protects even when stone cold, and with no speakers plugged in) I called sony and they say it is a short in the box. So now my two options are to unhook everything, repack EXACTLY the way it came to me and reship back to the online store I bought it from (with enormous hastle and expense) or take the receiver in to a sony authorized service center (which happens to be across town, and only open monday-friday, 9-5pm. So much for being convenient). This thing is brand new and already needs repairs!!\n",

       "My shuffle suffered the blinking green-orange lights so I took it into the Apple store. A salesman took 15 minutes to figure out that he couldn't do anything, and said I would have to sign up for a appointment at the \"Genius\" bar. At that appointment, the \"genius\" said he couldn't fix it, and because he said he didn't know anything about engineering he couldn't say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both. Apparently being an Apple \"genius\" doesn't involve understanding how things work, though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut. The 'genius\" then offered a $10 discount on the purchase of a new shuffle - but couldn't answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing.\n",

       "Here is the original review of this machine I wrote on June 17, 2006:\n",
       "\n",
       "We bought this machine just over a year ago (a year and two weeks, to be specific).  We had another very similar Panasonic DVD recorder (DMR-E55) in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch DVD-RAMs on both.  For a long time, the ES10S recorder worked fine.  Recently, though, it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down, and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks, ejecting them, and even playing them.  At first we thought this might be because we'd recorded over the DVD-RAMs so many times.  But today we tested one of them in the other machine, which has never made any similar noises, and the E55 had no problems with it.  Needless to say, we're not happy that the ES10S seems to be dying, especially since the 1-year warranty just ended.  If you buy or own this machine, follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you're within the warranty period, because the noises and problems just get worse.  Panasonic is usually a reliable brand, one we've used for many years, but this machine seems to be a lemon.  We're actually going to write to Panasonic about it--I'll try to post again with the results.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here is my update, which I wrote November 3:\n",
       "\n",
       "This is a follow-up review to the one above, which I wrote on June 17. I wrote to Panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended. They sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair, including labor, of the machine at one of three places they listed. The places were all within a half-hour drive of my home. After doing some research, I chose one and brought in the machine. They fixed it by replacing \"the entire internal mechanism\" (I don't know what that means). We got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of July; it's now the beginning of November. The fixed machine worked fine for a while, but in the past few weeks, we've been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before. I'm going to try writing to Panasonic again and asking for a refund, because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it. It's still working, but I know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won't. Avoid this machine. Again, the previous Panasonic model (DMR-E55) we bought hasn't had any of these difficulties and continues to work great. We're still big Panasonic fans, but this particular model is a lemon.\n",

However, after awhile the iHome will not register my iPods existence at all. Today I was able to enjoy thirty seconds of a song before it fell into disgrace again. I would not recommend this product if you want something that lasts. This device has become nothing more than a nuisance that won't even pick up radio stations. So, the alarm can only be set to a vaguely annoying beep when these functions are disabled. Useless\n",

If they could fix this quality problem, it would be well worth the $100, but since it is very hard to get it to recognize the connection reliably you just can't justify it at any price\n",

The iPod docking port is really flimsy, and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves.  After a little bit of use, the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down, and sometimes the sound cuts out all together.\n",

       "If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldn't stress the electronics, I'd give this thing 5 stars.  But without that, it simply breaks quickly, and no longer performs its only job - to sound good.\n",

(I always verify data DVD's, since errors in those are not ignorable.) But with Memorex, I've gotten about 20% failures, including a couple of aborted burns! In one case, the disc had a blank band between two burned ones!\n",

Hiss abounds, several local stations I heard previously are now unreachable, and to top it off, Sony has stuck with their time-honored habit of using proprietary connectors, so when I went to plug in an after-market antenna to get better reception, I found a weird little plug that I hadn't noticed when I put the damned thing together.  Grrr.  So now I'm going to sell this thing and buy a nice new Panasonic with the proceeds.  Death to Sony\n",

       "I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin,  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS\n",

       "While the silicon used in the construction of the sleeve is very nice (feels grippy but not sticky if you know what I mean), some of the features are just wrong.  For instance, the opening for the hold switch on top was apparently cut wrong and does not line up with the switch at all - requiring you to have to push the cover around so you can flip the hold on or off.  Also, for whatever reason, the edge of the sleeve is right at the headphone jack which causes it to be somewhat difficult to keep some headphones seated during use (the sleeve can work its way in and pop the jack out).  \n",

       "I was tempted by the cheap price and got myself a 10 pack. They are rated at 2000 mAh, but run out of juice after the digital camera has shot maybe 5 frames. My 2 year old Panasonic 1600 mAh in contrast can run the same camera for over a 100 shots. I tried these batteries in my MP3 player - and even there, it won't supply enough juice after an hr worth of playback. It is not that the battery does not hold any charge - that it has. But it just does not supply the peak current required by most digital devices. It seems to be all right for use in a flashlight. A set of batteries that will not power a camera will power a flashlight (a bit dimly) for hours (yeah - I tested it). For the test, I had  charged the panasonics and the lenmars for the same duration (it is not a charger issue).\n",
       "I plan to complain to the state consumer affairs department regarding this brand and hope action is taken against shady products which are nothing but rip-offs.\n",
       "One last tip - nowadays, the best NiMH batteries are made by Sanyo. It is better to pay 2 - 4 times for them than for a Lenmar. Trust me\n",

       "The Tomtom has great features.  But I returned mine.  First, the maps are very dated.  This makes it iffy at best.  It has terrific potential, if it worked.  You can use a PDA stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip.  It's amazing.  But I wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it's internal maps and waypoints.  But I tried a local test first.  I used roads as waypoints, main roads.  This way I can force the Tomtom to use MY routes.  I did not like it's choices, since it is a dated map database.  I set up a local route, and started to follow it.  It took me to the first road/waypoint no problem.  But it would not go past the first waypoint.  I would go down the road (first waypoint) then it would tell me to take a u turn!.  I did.  Then it said take another u turn.  It had me going in circles.  Perhaps it's not made to use roads as waypoints, but all indications it gave were that it would.  The manual was no help.  Support was no help.  So it went back.  I have ordered a Garmin i2.  Hope this is ok.  I have taken the same trip from SE FL USA to SC USA with a Garmin C330.  The Garmin has maps that you cannot update, but got me to my destination no problem.\n",

       "\n",
       "I shopped around, and this item looked appropriate. As for the short cord, I solved that issue by getting a USB extension cord at the same time. Besides solving the immediate problem, this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point, and using the extension cord for some other purpose.\n",

       "For a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do. I attached an external hard drive through it. I used it for a compact flash card reader, and a digital camera. I connected an inkjet printer. Everything worked, once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly. (This was all with Windows 98 SE.)\n",
       "\n",
       "But after a while, things started getting less reliable. The system would tell me that various \"drives\" (on the flash card reader, or the external hard drive) were not available. Or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software. And the printer even started disappearing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Playing with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life, and eventually I deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose, or with wiring inside the device. Either way, it has finally become a big problem, and I am shopping for a replacement.\n",

       "Most of the devices I connected were self-powered, that is, they did not need to draw power from the hub or the PCI channel at all. The hard drive, camera, and printer were all powered by batteries or AC adapters of their own. And the flash card reader, which did draw power from the hub, used to work fine. It does not matter what combination of devices I try, sooner or later the connection goes bad.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is of course possible that there's something wrong in the PC -- but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself. So I have to recommend against buying it. I suspect it is discontinued and that this advice won't be necessary for much longer, but I want to prevent somebody from the bother I've been through, just in case\n",

The one I got came with a CD with the wrong drivers. With tech support, I finally found the 8 mb driver file I was supposed to download. However, they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver. The normal \"automatic\" approach did not work. And their instructions did not match the screens I was getting on Windows XP SP 2.\n",

It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.

This purchase has scared me away from anything else related to Memorex. I thought Memorex was a very reliable brand and they would make sure they were sending out top notch items to consumers. I guess I was wrong. And apparently you get what you pay for. Don't be fooled by the good price. You'll just be out of your money and stuck with discs that wouldn't even be worth using as a frisbee.

The kicker is that this spring, I also ordered two spindles of these discs (exactly the same as far as I can tell), from which I burned one hundred discs (not a single faulty one!) for a freind overseas.  I have no idea what the deal is, but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs.  Anyone got ideas?\n",

       "I bought the ADS upconverter because I bought a HDTV only to find out that my cable co. didn't offer HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer HDTV (too many trees around my house).  I wasn't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV picture, but for $550+ I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable.  When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought.  She looked at the TV and said okay I'm ready turn it on.  I said \"it IS ON!!\" This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it.  The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different, but that's all it was, different.  It was NOT noticably better.  In fact, in some instances I though the picture was worse.  I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for (even though that's not what I got it for).  So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter.  It didn't matter what display format I put it in it just didn't do anything to improve the picture.  Save your money.  If you can't get HDTV don't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing\n",

       "It didn't work properly from the time it came out of the box.  The carousel wouldn't make a complete rotation, so CDs and DVDs would  get 'trapped' inside the unit.  And occasionally, it would simply refuse to play a DVD altogether.  Panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop, so maybe they can get it to function as it should.  If you do purchase one, please read the warranty carefully;  a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one.  Panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones, under any circumstances. \n",

       "This unit failed to provide reliable power to my new Toshiba Satellite A60 laptop. It cycled on and off every 3 seconds. It powered a 100 watt lamp okay, but wouldn't start a 250 watt heat lamp at all. Product spec sheet says it can supply 400 watt surge and 200 watts for 2 min., and is rated at 140 watts continuous. My laptop power supply is rated at 2A input at 100-240 VAC, and if it drew 2A constantly I agree that it would need 200 to 230 watts, which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter. However, even at that power demand the inverter should run it for 1-2 min., but only manages 3 sec.  In addition, I doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full 2.0 amps continuously. I talked to Linksys support, and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund, so I did. It did not work for me. Maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs 100 watts, but I wouldn't recommend it for more than that\n",

       "I purchased this wireless card based on the price, figuring that even if it didn't live up to the good reviews here, I would only be out ~$20.  The set up was easy and smooth, but the card won't stay connected to my wireless network.  I've got a Belkin wireless router.  The Trendnet signal meter generally shows ~95% signal strength, but the connection only lasts for a few minutes, and I have to keep cycling the connection to regain network access--very annoying.  I know there's nothing wrong with the network because my laptop's connection is stable.  I purchased a D-Link card, and it has worked flawlessly.  Unfortunately, I threw away the packaging when the Trendnet card arrived; if I hadn't, then this card would be on its way back to Amazon now.  Like the title of my review says: you get what you pay for . . . \n",

It works great for about 3 or 4 months on average.  After that, the voice unit stops working.  I can hear others speaking to me but no one can hear me.  I have gone through 4 of these units in 13 months and the longest lived unit lasted &lt; 5 months.  One broke after &lt; 2 months.

It's even worse when you use the manual feed. HP has no answers because they deny all the issues. HP's support is lackluster at best anyway. The first time when this machine was under warranty it took me three weeks worth of phone calls to get anything accomplished with them. Stay away from this printer at all costs. If you own one it makes a nice doorstop or paperweight. This is totally unacceptable considering toner and printer costs. I expect more from a product with the HP brand stamped on the box.

       "We travel quite a bit, both business and pleasure, domestic and international... so the idea of a pocket wireless router was a God send.  We bought this one at the beginning of our annual leave (aka tour the US in a month).  We'd heard good things about the D-Link but with the rebates, this one was practically free.... there was a reason it's always on sale.  \n",
       "It took forever to set up.  The old firmware is buggy, the new firmware is difficult and touchy to install.  The router itself does not seem to be compatible with most personal cable/DSL modems.  Out of the eight houses we were in, it would only work with one, although it appeared to connect with several others.  It did work with the Ethernet connection of about 70% of the hotels... but that's not a great average.  It also gets very very hot and than will quit working until it cools down again.  Frustrating.\n",
       "After the first week we went out and got the pocket D-Link.. excellent- plug it in and it works EVERYWHERE: personal homes, questionable modems, hotels, etc... we have used it from Alabama to Bangkok and everywhere in between.  It's also about half the size of the Netgear.  Save the hassle and get it first.\n",
       "... also a tip, pick up a little usb wi-fi adaptor with your router.  You will find that many people without a wireless router already, will only have a desktop, and you will need to make it \"wireless\" as you will be connecting their modem to your router.\n",

       "I hoping to use the WGR101 to provide wireless, encrypted access to two laptops from a wired ethernet connection in a hotel. It worked fine in single-user, no encryption mode but that is not what I needed. I experienced severe problems trying to use it in single user mode with WEP or in multi-user mode with and without WEP. One or both laptops would lose the ability to connect to the internet at seemingly random intervals. Sometimes cycling the laptop wireless radio would restablish the connection, sometimes I had to reboot the laptops, sometimes I had to reboot the WGR101, and sometimes I had to reboot the laptops and the WGR101. Stay away from this product unless single user, unencrypted access is what you need\n",

       "My Sangean DT200V pocket radio failed after 2.5 years of infrequent use.  I kept it in a padded pocket of my briefcase where it experienced no significant shocks or temperature extremes.  It worked perfectly on the few occasions when I used it over the 2.5 year period, until yesterday.  The buttons, switches, and display still work perfectly, but only very faint white noise can be heard, whether via speaker or via earphone.  The volumn of the faint white noise is not significantly affected by the volumn control.  The batteries are new, and there is no corrosion from the previous batteries. \n",

       "Perhaps I got a lemon, but I feel wary of buying another DT200V for 2 reasons:\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  From the day I got it, the power button was so sensitive that a tiny waft of air (no kidding) would turn it off (or back on) at whim.  Right in the middle of a song, or talk, this shortly became maddening.\n",
       "\n",
       "Since this is unacceptable for a $50-range radio; and since I didn't want to spend as much money mailing it to and fro as it was worth, instead of sending it back -(OH looking back, how I should have!)- I opened it up myself, and had to physically shave down the plastic underside of the on/off button where it touched the internal power switch.  As I couldn't conversely move the guts further from the button, this was the only solution.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thankfully this worked, and the on/off button did not give me further problems after this.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "However,\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  Not many weeks or months of use in, the radio developed this habit of shorting out or something to where my pre-set stations just scanned as blank 'fuzz' (no station, not even 'intelligent' fuzz/crackle like it knew a station existed anywhere on the planet) and I could get zero stations of anything at all--not FM, not AM, and no TV.\n",
       "\n",
       "This would happen right after turning the radio on, and I should note that I always used headphones (not the ones supplied; as with most, throw them away, they're not worth it).  It seemed to me through trial and error that just turning the radio on was fine, but the act of plugging in some headphones joggled some connection or shorted something out, and did this.\n",
       "\n",
       "I tried several different pair and types of headphones (some with noise cancelling switches, some without, and with these On and Off), and used the 'lock' switch on the radio both in the on and off position while plugging in my headphones (as the company I bought them from recommended turning the lock switch on when changing batteries, to prevent shorts), but nothing I have done has prevented this from eventually happening again...repeatedly.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is really annoying when it does, as removing the batteries (which always will lose all your presets, by the way) and waiting several minutes rarely clears the short.\n",
       "\n",
       "Weirdly, the thing I've found which clears the short or re-makes whatever connection is messed up correct itself, is opening up the back (screwdriver required) and kind of pushing the guts (board) one direction or another, kind of scooting it (there's minimal movement available, though), and saying a little prayer and putting the whole thing back together again.  Most of the time, that has worked.  Occasionally, I've had to repeat the process 3-5 times before it will.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sometimes it lasts several weeks before this'll happen again, other times, it happens multiple times a day.  The day I can't fix it (I don't even know what I'm doing that's fixing it!), I'll throw it across the room, against a wall, and I probably _won't_ buy another one.\n",
       "(If I do, I'm keeping the receipt, NEVER opening up the back as it voids any warranty, and returning it (not for repairs--for a refund!) the split second it gives me any trouble of any kind.)\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "For all this, I grudgingly say that it does have very good reception quality of FM (I almost exclusively listen to this), pulls the stations in nicely, and has very low amount of static.  When one particular station does, it's usually more the fault of distance, or we're getting out of range, or the batteries are very low- that's at fault.\n",
       "\n",
       "Indoors in a computer-saturated office-cubby environment and not near a window, though, I'd have to say, it has had some significant problems pulling in any more than 3-4 strong-signal stations without major static.  But your office environs may vary.  (Some are more electrical field saturated than most.)\n",
       "\n",
       "The FM (musical) sound quality itself is good/decent, and I might say better than many...but my 1 criticism on it is a certain 'canniness' of sound quality (across various headphones I've plugged in).  It's lacking some fullness of the midrange, and warmth.  Also, the bass is not what it could be.  I'm not sure given its overall sound quality signature if the addition of a bass boost button would have helped it or not.\n",
       "\n",
       "For me, clarity and volume have helped me ignore some of the lesser aspects of the DT200V's sound signature.  However, shopping for my next purchase, that will move up higher in importance\n",

I only use the mouse about 6 hours a week so I should be getting a lot more battery life.

       "Note: I'm a network engineer, so the dual-fixed-ip recommendation [one for each segment] is actually pretty normal in other network bridging appliances. I suspect the MS game adapter simply performs the DHCP handshake better than this unit and that is why it is so easy to setup. \n",

       "I purchased this device to add to my wireless network, which uses a Belkin wireless router.  I had to connect the router directly to the game adapter since it could not be detected by my wireless router.  After configuring it, I could never find it once it was disconnected from the ethernet cable from my wireless router.  I made three attempts at customer service - my first call was disconnected after 20 minutes, the second call was working with a woman in India, who's headset had a ton of static to add to her accent.  I had to end that session because we couldn't hear each other.  I then used online chat, and after 90 minutes I still had not solved my problem, and that session was disconnected for unknown reasons.  The lady from India did mention that mixing their product with any other wireless router would be a problem, and now I believe her\n",

My only option is to buy a new one and wasn't even offered a discounted price for it.  I have seen several complaints like mine about KOSS on the web.  They make JUNK and they make it to last just to get past the warranty period and then it breaks.  Oh, by the way I loved it until it broke\n",

       "I recently purchased a refurbished Toshiba Gigabeat F40 for about $150. Quite a bargain for a 40-gig MP3 player. However, upon reflection, I regret the purchase.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Gigabeat hardware seems to be OK, with good sound quality etc. The major failing is with the included software. As other reviews have pointed out, the Gigabeat will only play encrypted tracks. The Gigabeat is supplied with Gigabeat Room application software to provide the necessary encryption. Gigabeat Room starts automatically when connected to the PC via the USB port. From the time the Gigabeat is connected till the Gigabeat Room application is displayed on the screen is 30 minutes. If you switch from viewing the Gigabeat file directory to the PC file directory, the application hangs. If you try to update your track library, the application hangs. I have yet to get  through a single operation from beginning to end without the program hanging. Every time the Gigabeat Room hangs, you have to restart the application, with yet another 30-minute wait to resume. The file directory on the Gigabeat is usually out of sync with what is actually present on the hard drive. Microsoft Media Player version 10 may also be used to synchronize the Gigabeat. I have a 35-gig library. It took Media Player 18 hours to encrypt and copy all 8100 tracks to the Gigabeat. In short, be prepared for a maddening and time consuming experience with this player. Software that gives error messages such as \"The Program Is Quitted\" and with such obvious fragility may have been expected in 1986 but is absolutely unreasonable in 2006.\n",
       "\n",
       "In my estimation you would be much better off purchasing an MP3 player, even at greater cost, that can play MP3 files directly, with file maintenance provided by Windows Explorer and or Media Player.\n",

       "\n",
       "But, my complaint is RELIABILITY and SUPPORT...for the two years I have had Dish my TV picture seems to go out every 6 months or so.  Everytime I talk to Dish customer service I get a different reason why it could be out.  Several times I have gotten new DVR boxes mailed to me and there is always a dispute about who should pay.  Several times I have had Dish Net come out to my house and they have always tried to make me pay until I told them I'm tired of the hassel and just cancel me.  Now my dish is out again this weekend and I am missing the Ohio State / Michigan game because my TV says no Dish Signal (reason tbd).\n",

       "Anyway, if it worked consistently as advertised I would give it 4 or 5 stars.  But due to reliability I give it 2 stars.  And with Murphy's Law it always goes down when you want to watch that big event (prompting me to write this review instead of watching the game today)!!  I may have to switch back to cable.\n",

       "All ports began running slow after just 6 months of use. Followed LinkSys RMA process and they sent me a hub in return by mistake. I followed yet another LinkSys RMA process and had to wait TWO MONTHS for the replacement switch covering their mistake. The replacement switch died after 1 week of use. The latest RMA unit ran excessively Hot until the smell of burning plastic left the air and then it would not power up. This is what I have learned about Linksys: #1) This should be a simple network pass-through device and it should not fail unless manufactured poorly - Linksys apparently cannot make a good one. #2) Do not even think about turning a broken unit into Linksys under their RMA process, they will simply send you a refurbished unit and it cannot be trusted. If these cheap switches fail they cannot be fixed and the original manufacture was flawed in the first place. #3) Choose a competitors product - I have had other brand switches running for years with no issues\n",

Neither one works.Another irritation, I am already getting a popup that says the \"signal\" is weak -- about 18\" away, yet the menu says it is fine I got a great buy on it at OfficeDepot (half price), otherwise I would return it\n",

       "The ONLY reason i bought this unit when I saw it in the store was for the iPod controller feature.  I really looked forward to being able to control my iPod from the deck and hiding my ipod in my dash completely out of sight.  Boy was I disappointed!  The iPod adpater works and all... but barely.  It takes FOREVER to scroll through the songs, artists or albums.  Why the hell would Alpine put out a product that has an inferior scrolling mechanism and then lock you out of the iPod so you can't even select songs from the iPod itself?  I have over 3000 songs on my iPod... by the time I scroll to the song I want I've already reached my destination... and that's if I even find the song at all!  So now what I have to do is unplug my iPod, scroll to the song I want, then plug it back in. (Luckily the reciever continues to play whatever song was already playing when you plug your iPod in.)  But again... that defeats the whole point of having the controls built into the deck.  Bottom line, the iPod control feature flat SUCKS.  The deck features a \"quick search\" function... but it is uselss... it isn't used to search through artsts or albums... only individual songs and there's no way to skip 10, 20, 30 or 100 songs at a time... only 1 by 1... What's \"quick\" about that?   I have 3000 songs and hundreds of artists and albums and Alpine thinks I'm supposed to go through them 1 by 1???? Another annoying thing about this unit is that when you skip through songs while the iPod is playing, the display just says \"song up\" or \"song down\" instead of just showing the name of the damn song!  Who thought of that?  What possible help could \"song up\" be to anyone? Just show the name of the song while I'm skipping through... that makes more sense right?  There are a bunch of other problems I have with the practicalness of this unit when used with the iPod adapter and iPod... but the sound quality is great which is the most important thing... but then again... who cares if the sound is great when it takes you all day to find the song you want to listen to\n",

       "I bought an Alpine 9847 and the Ipod interface. I works but it totally hijacks your Ipod. The beautiful intuitve, fast controls on the Ipod itself are locked out and you can ONLY control the Ipod from the car stereo. It is therefore very hard to deal with especially if you have a large music catalog on you Ipod. It is very slow, not at all intuitive. Even after getting used to it it is no good. The info on artist, album or song title imports from the IPod very slowly. Turning the volume knob is equivalent to circling on the Ipod but one turn eqauls about 3 spots on the list unlike one circle on the Ipod which equals dozens of spots on the list. Therefore if you have a large catalog you have to spin the volume knob 100 times to get thru a long catalog list which takes forever........Very annoying, very slow, very cumbersome. If only it did not deactivate the normal controls on the Ipod itself. A better and much cheaper solution is to find a car stereo with some form of line in, either stereo mini plug or RCA jacks. The just connect directly and use the IPods own controls which are infinitely better. I replace an old stereo to get the Ipod option and am very sorry I did so\n",

       "I just purchased this product. In the instruction manual, it states that only the Brother AC adapter should be used and any other will invalidate the warranty. Why is it that only a Brother adapter can be used when AC adapters are supposed to be standard? A tactic to increase sales? The adapter itself costs an additional 15 to 20 dollars. In addition, I agree with some of the other reviewers that a significant amount of label is wasted with each printing due to the empty space on either side that must be cut off. The 2 line printing does look very nice. I have not used many of the other features and so cannot comment on those\n",

       "Don't even accept it as a freebie (as I did) unless you are prepared to pay $1.15 per sheet for color ink.  That was my experience with the first color cartridge, which was fully consumed on a total of 20 sheets, 12 of which were heavy color, the others being mixed color and text or very light color.  At $17.99 per color cartridge and $14.99 for black I calculate the outrageous, obscene $1.15 per sheet figure for ink.  This is about six times greater than the average ink cost for my old HP720c, which unfortunately does not work with my new HP Pavilion PC (no printer port on this model, among other issues).  I have vowed to not purchase any HP product in the future if I can possibly avoid it.  I just ordered a Canon Pixima to replace this ink hog.  On the positive side, the print quality is good, speed is excellent, and color fidelity is fair.  The software installed without incident, and the machine is easy to operate, but the HP software is overbearing and constantly trying to sell you something--worse than daytime television\n",

       "It's not often I find a product that's as disappointing as this. The interference problem is very serious and makes most conversations a pain. Moving around the house and outside of the house, standing on your head holding the phone at a 45 angle, etc., are part of the daily ritual in trying to hold a legibible conversation.\n",
       "\n",
       "But that's not the bad part. The bad part, as at least one other reviewer has noted, is that each of the phones constantly reports a  \"low charge\" message or something similar. This in spite of the fact that we make minimal use of the phones and leave them in the charger most of the time. The only solution I've found is to take the battery out of phone and put it back in. Then it will work for a day or two. I suppose it could be just the batteries. But if so then we were shipped batteries that were already on life-support.\n",

       "I had this for approximately 2 years. It worked fine for couple of months but suddenely started to activate the alarm without any disturbances. One day I left my laptop attached the alarm in my office for about half an hour. During this period, the alarm was activated and I was embarrased to face my office workers. This is without increasing the sensitivity of the alarm. I sent it back to Targus and they were nice enough to give me a new alarm. But after several months, it started the same problem.\n",
       " So, now I am afraid to use this security system with my laptop. But I did not face problems like changing the combination by its own. You can use it without the alarm activation (i.e: without batteries) but the cable is so thin, it is not recommended to protect any valubles\n",

       "I bought this item after seeing the almost uniformly good reviews including the one that says there is good Macintosh support.  Unfortunately the player does not work well with the Macintosh.  The included software often crashes and does not seem to be able to import DSS files.  The software can move the files between the recorder and the computer but the files do not appear in the software window.  The use interface is also fairly crude and looks as if it was ported directly from Windows 3.1.  The DS-2 appears to the finder as a standard USB disk and I have been able to copy the DSS files from the player to the compuer using the finder.  It is then possible to play the DSS files by double clicking them, but it will only play one file.  If you want to play another file it is necessary to completely quit the DSS player and relanch it.  Exporting the files to a format usable by other software such as AIFF is also nearly impossible.  There is an export function in the menu, when it is selected it asks were the new file should be saved but no file ever appears.  Unfortunately there is no other Macintosh software available to read or convert DSS files as Olympus refuses to allow others use the the format on the Macintosh.  Search of the internet reveals that others have found extremely painful ways of converting the DSS files such as playing the entire file and re-recording it with another program\n",

They are only two months old and I always keep them in the case!  I had to solder it back together and then super glue the bud back together.  Since then I've also had to superglue the right bud as well.  Also, the cable sheath is fraying over one bud lead, revealing the fine speaker wire underneath.  I don't expect these phones to last much longer which is too bad.  They are great sounding and comfortable, but unfortunately they seem to have cut some important corners.  Be warned\n",

       " These headphones are so expensive and they are aweful! I dont remember if it was the left or the right but one side of the cord is longer than the other; its very annoying! I tried to loosen it and the wire was showing, what a piece of s***. Its very annoying because the ear bud fell out when I listened to music and it doesnt feel comfortable. Also the rubber on the ear bud falls off very easily. They are too expensive for a piece of junk! The only reason I rate it two stars is because the sound is great on the headphones. Instead purchase the Sony SRF-HM01V S2 Sports Walkman Street Style Headphone Radio. I purchased those after these fell apart and they are much better :)\n",

There's always exceptions to rules, and the rule, \"the more you pay, the more you get\" is the exception to the rule for this web camera. After getting it, I had difficulty in getting the software to load but eventually had success. I was very disappointed in the video quality. There seemed to be a lot of noise in the picture, and tweaking gave no improvement. I returned it to Amazon and took a lose in the return shipping cost, but considered it worth it just to get the price of the camera back. Amazon lived up to their part and refunded the price paid (less return shipment) with no hassle\n",

       "I read all of the reviews here and thought these would be the best option for easy transport AND low ambient sound i-pod headpohones without breaking the bank (I'm on a plane frequently). I wanted something that I wouldn't cry over breaking or losing during my many travels. I found that the uneven cord lengths are very irritating- especially if you like to use only one plug (like maybe at your desk at work). The weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite uncomfortable- even when sitting still. So then I thought these will be great workout headphones (won't be upset if I break or lose them), HOWEVER, the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand. The effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience (even when you are sitting stationary at your desk). It is similar to wearing a stethescope, which defeats the point of wearing in-the-ear headphones (which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise). I do not recommend these headphones, because of this stethescope effect- I could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses (they are after all designed to wear behind the head). I'm on the hunt for better quality headphones\n",

       "I like this style of headphone radio (especially when I jog), and haven't found any similar models that I like. This is my third purchase of this radio.  Each of the three have had problems.  First died completely (although it was used a lot).  Second still works, but last number doesn't show up on digital display.  I wanted a backup in case second died, so I ordered another one.  This third works least well of all.  At times, entire display is off, radio doesn't work at all, or it won't change channels.  Then other times it worked. Seems like might be affected by heat outside. However, I know have another persistent problem.  That being, it won't let me program the preset stations.  Again, I'm limited in my choices, and I use this type headphone a lot.  So I suffer through poor quality\n",

       "Isolation:\n",
       "I had to use the foam inserts because the plastic ones were a little too large for my ears. With the foam, it completely sealed my ear canal and blocked out most noise.  My commute home on the J train (light-rail) was quite silent.  I was listening to classical music for the first time on the train.  With earbuds, I had to put the volume level around 50%.  With the Sony MDR-EX71 model, I could to keep it around 40%.  The noise attenuation wasn't that good with the Sony model, but definitely better than earbuds (but the sound quality was quite terrible though.)\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Sound Quality:\n",
       "Superb sound.  The partnership with Etymotic Research is evident.  Everything sounded great:  rock, grunge, classical.  The Sonys sounded really muddy while these had a really bright sound with good bass (when the seal was good).  Very balanced sound.\n",
       "\n",
       "Cord/Construction:\n",
       "I string my earphones through an REI One jacket, so this was more or less perfect length.  The cord is symmetric so it's not weirdly strung behind your neck like the Sonys, and the connection to the ear pieces is solid, not fragile-looking like the ER6.  The earphones connect to the replaceable eartips very tightly.  The included case is ridiculous though; it's way too bulky for portability.\n",
       "\n",
       "Comfort/Fit:\n",
       "Sadly, this is primary reason I'm returning these.  Both the flanged rubber tips and the included foam tips were too big.  The foam models got the seal, but they were too big, so I felt an uncomfortable amount of pressure in my ear canals.  Those were my only two options with the included package.  The other problem is that I cannot find replacements that are smaller, anywhere on the web, including the Altec Lansing site.\n",
       "\n",
       "Documentation:\n",
       "Another reason I am returning these is the documentation.  The manual says that I can get replacement ear tips and accessories at alteclansing.com/inmotionearphones, and I get a 404 error when I visit the link.  That is pretty pathetic.\n",
       "\n",
       "Update:  (1/19/2006)I emailed Altec Lansing regarding this issue on 1/10/2006, and I have yet to get a response from them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bottom Line:\n",

The bass reproduction is simply horrid.  I read somewhere there is a \"break-in\" period.  I have found this not to be true.  They sound just as bad after 50 hours of listening as they did brand new.  This is my first pair of Sennheiser and am very disappointed.  I know they are low-end headphones - but I expected more.

       "During the installation of the software on my PC running Windows 2000 Server, the installation program froze my PC completely. I had to turn off the PC, and now it does nothing when I turn it on. The lights on the front light up, but nothing happens at all. I called Netgear, waited on hold for 15 minutes, and then was connected to a gentleman whose English was not very good. I explained my problem about 5 times before he seemed to get it. He told me that the problem is that the product is not compatible with Win 2000 Server. I told him that I had never before encountered a piece of software that ran on 2000 Pro, but not 2000 Server (perhaps there are some), but he insisted that this was the case. I explained that, typically, installation programs that encounter and incompatible operating system would display a message to the user, and exit, rather than freezing and disabling the computer, but he held firm, and advised me that there was nothing he could do to help, and that he recommended that I contact my computer vendor so that they could restore my initial configuration. \n",
       "\n",
       "I went around and around with this fellow, then finally asked for his supervisor. After another 15 minutes on hold, another guy came on the line, who was pretty fluent in English. He explained his understanding of the situation, which was still wrong, and I explained the whole thing again to him. He had me turn the computer on and off, which of course I had already done several times, and check the monitor connection. After this analysis, he determined that the situation could not possibly have been the result of the frozen software installation that occurred just prior to it, and must be some other problem with my PC that had previously been working perfectly, that, coincidently, occurred at the exact same time as the software freeze. I expressed skepticism towards this explanation, and asked him if he would believe that if it was his PC. He said that absolutely he would, and reassured me that there was NO POSSIBLE WAY, (emphasis his) that his software could have caused these symptoms. \n",
       "\n",
       "Since I understood that it would be difficult for him to actually fix a computer in this state over the phone, I suggested that I could take it to a local technician, and send Netgear the bill for repairing my system. He declined that offer.\n",

It worked perfectly with my old Thinkpad, but not long thereafter I got a Thinkpad T60, thinking, \"Hey, universal means universal, of course it will work\". But no: SIX MONTHS after the T60 was introduced, Kensington STILL hasn't gotten their act together to produce a \"SmartTip\" for it. They haven't even added Lenovo to the list of manufacturers on their web site! All Customer Service can say is that they don't have one, they don't know when or if they ever will, and they suggest that I check back on the website someday if I still hold out any hope. So, I have a $100 brick on my hands. Very disappointing, Kensington.\n",

And it's not like there's some technical problem: the T60 needs 20 volts, 90 watts, well within the 24-volt, 120-watt capability of this unit.  However, six months delay in supporting a major business computer brand is just unforgivable, so I can no longer recommend it\n",

I've gotten so I just ask if they're using a Plantronics CS50 when they are faint and the answer is invariably \"yes\".

       "For some years I tried this and other Monster products, to the tune of over $1000 in Monster a/v gear. The more you learn about video and audio, the more you'll avoid anything with the Monster label. Specifically, this s-video meets no NTSC, DVD or IEEE standard; it is common 30-ohm hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed, low-conductance connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding. Has a sharp image, but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from off-color skin tones to color blotching, dirty grays, burned highlights, murky shadows, noisy reds, and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds. Makes video test patterns look great, but who watches test patterns all day? Amazon offers many other brands at good prices, why waste your $$ on this stuff? I removed every piece of Monster from my system and replaced them with AR, Belden, Viewsonics and others from Amazon. Result: vast improvement in every respect.\n",

       "I bought this adapter along with the Linksys WRT54GL Broadband Router.  I managed to set them up and install them properly.  (The best advice I got from the \"Home Networking for Dummies\" book was to get a 100 foot Cat5e patch cable so that I could put my router in the place I where I wanted it, and hook it up with a wired connection first.  I actually only needed a 50 foot cable, and got it for $20 from a local electronics supply store.)\n",
       "\n",
       "So I got everything up and running (remember to install your router first, and then your network adapter), surfed the internet for awhile, and then shut down my computer.  Here's where the trouble started....\n",
       "\n",
       "As other reviewers have noted, the Linksys installation makes changes to your Windows XP configuration, de-activating the Welcome screen and the feature Microsoft calls \"Fast User Switching.\"  This happens with no warning.\n",
       "\n",
       "When I went to turn on my computer again, I got a new start-up screen for Windows, demanding a password.  I freaked out, because I don't remember ever setting a password for Windows.  I called Linksys, and was extremely unimpressed with their customer support.  The young woman seemed to be amused by my problem, and was actually laughing at me.  She began to start me through the process of completely re-setting the router to the factory settings (this would NOT have helped).\n",
       "\n",
       "What finally helped was figuring out (with no help from Linksys) that if you never set a password for your Windows XP logon, all you have to do is hit \"Enter\" at the password prompt.  That's all there is.  Linksys could have told me this, or better yet, warned before installation that these changes to Windows XP would take place and suggest setting up a User Password in advance.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another gripe about this network adapter and the Linksys router--neither came with instruction manuals.  There is a 60-page instruction manual on the CD rom that comes with the product, but you'll have to print it out yourself (Do it before you install or try installing the product).  In the case of the router, I also had to do deep searching to actually find the instruction manual on the CD-ROM--it wanted to start up the Setup Wizard automatically and the instruction manual was not easy to access from the CD-ROM.  I guess this may be the norm now with computer hardware, but it still stinks.\n",
       "\n",
       "I do not recommend the Linksys WUSB54GC, primarily because of the unannounced changes it makes to the Windows XP system, and because of Linksys' non-existent or non-functional and rude customer support\n",

       "  Essentially once TomTom has your money they're finished with you . . . until you want to spend more money with them.\n",
       "\n",
       "  The product is okay. The map data is from TeleAtlas, a vendor to many of the map software producers. What makes TomTom different is its GUI (Graphic User Interface) that the user interacts with. It really is a work of art most of the time. The map presentations are rich and may be viewed as 3D or 2D. The planning interface is icon driven and easy-to-use. Unfortunately TomTom really didn't think it all the way through.\n",
       "\n",
       "  There are several irritants, all of which vie for first place. One is that TomTom doesn't give you the option of using its maps without a GPS. There are many instances where I know where I am begining from and going to and I don't need a GPS fix. TomTom ignores such desires and annoyingly keeps prompting for you to start your Bluetooth connection. There is one mode that you can use to plan a route without a GPS and it simply doesn't work very well, often informing you that TomTom can't route you from a point beginning on an interstate to another point further along the same highway. That's just plain dumb. This is a mapping application. If I want to use these expensive maps for walking directions without a GPS, I should be able to. TomTom certainly doesn't think so.\n",
       "\n",
       "  Another irritant is the documentation. Probably in an effort to make TomTom appealing to the casual user, the documentation is dog simple . . . and often wrong. It appears that they didn't update the documentation to the newest version.\n",
       "\n",
       "  Although you can load maps by region, TomTom makes no allowance for travelling from one region to another. You have to calculate your route to the ending point within one region and then begin it anew in the next region. Again, this strikes me as a silly omission. If you are in Wisconsin, which is one region, and drive to Minnesota, which is in another, you have to create two routes. Not bright.\n",
       "\n",
       "  There are a number of idiosyncracies, anomalies and bugs that drive me up a wall. However, overall, TomTom is still better than the competition. It computes routes quickly (when it is capable of figuring a route at all). Annoying, however, it tends to prefer expressways, regardless of your preferences. In a major metro area laced with expressways going in all directions, this can create some incredibly convoluted - and ridiculous - routes. Creating alternative and more logical routes is possible, but tedious.\n",
       "\n",
       "  The worst part of the TomTom experience is its customer support. Well, perhaps support is the wrong word for it. I encountered two problems installing the software. It was obviously that the tech support person was clueless and was simply guessing and grasping at straws. (I had resolved the issues before the rep called and already knew what the problem was.) The TomTom rep didn't listen, kept interrupting and when it was pointed out that he was contradicting the manual, he just kept moving. (The manual in at least one instance was correct and the rep wrong.)\n",
       "\n",
       "  The TomTom packaging itself arrived in broken condition. The rep denied it was their packaging, claiming that I must have bought a third-party repackaged product. Talk about insulting: I have the package in front of me with the TomTom labels, the whole works and this guy is telling me that my lying eyes are deceiving me?\n",
       "\n",
       "  A fax to TomTom management about my experiences has gone unanswered more than a week later.\n",
       "\n",
       "  TomTom is riding high right now but I suspect in a couple of years as competitors introduce better products with better support that TomTom will be history. It won't be the first company that offered a good-enough product without support and possesing contempt for its customers to disappear and it won't be the last.\n",
       "\n",
       "  I know that if I find a marginally better product with adequate support, I'd abandon TomTom in a flash.\n",

Good question, well, I activated these maps on one PDA, and within 2 weeks my PDA died and I had to obtain warranty service. Well, I decided that I would upgrade to a new device and then sell my old device when I got it back from the manufacturers (I tend to switch my PDA every 3-4 months anyway).\n",

OK, I figure...no problem, I will be able to activate it 1...2...3 because after all, only I have the activation card/code. No such luck, TomTom wants PROOF that I have brought a new device? what kind of nonsense is that? What if I lost my PDA in 2-3 months? What if I'm a nut who likes to change PDA's every 3-4 months? What, you mean I have to show you proof that I switched? Isn't the fact that I have the activation card proof enough? I don't know too many people who pay $269 for a product and let other people use the activation codes.\n",

       "   My company car has a built-in GPS unit and I have gotten to like it, sort-of.  I have gotten lost in a rental car trolling around Silicon Valley enough to get a portable GPS unit.  After some research, the Garmin iQue 3600 is what I ended up with and I paid about $700.  The unique feature of this portable GPS unit is that a PalmPilot comes integrated into the package.   I use a PalmPilot, so this GPS unit replaces my PalmV.    Installation was quite awkward, and getting it up and running was a chore.   I got the thing synced up and some maps loaded and have been using it for several months now.  It does do the job, fitfully, and has several glaring issues.  Most irritating, the Palm function and the GPS function are not seamlessly integrated.  If an address is entered in the Palm part and then route to this address is selected, the iQue 3600 makes you find the location.  But the address from the Palm section doesn't transfer cleanly into the find section and you must retype the address.  I'm left-handed and graffiti has NEVER worked for me all my letters are drawn backward.  The GPS can be engaged as soon as it recognizes where you want to go, but my unit takes a good 5-10 minutes to find the satellites when first exposed to sky.   This means that I must have a good idea what to do for the first 5-10 minutes.  Sometimes I just drive randomly until the GPS locks in and starts to issue navigation orders.  Also, the antenna must be deployed to get any GPS reception and must be forward enough in the windshield to see sky.  This is OK, except that the iQue 3600 doesn't tell you that the antenna has not been deployed.  \n",
       "   The iQue 3600 does not work propped up on the passenger seat so a 5 pound holder is necessary to hold the unit on the dashboard.  If the antenna is not deployed, the iQue 3600 simply doesn't navigate and doesn't tell you why.  Worse, it acts stupid by going into a dangerous and unhelpful simulate mode.  If I ever figure out what that means, Ill tell you in a future post.  I figured out the antenna problem the hard way in an ice storm outside of Ottawa.  I'm a fan of GUI design, and I must say that the UI here is very, very bad.  Not the worse I have ever seen, but very bad:  non-intuitive, inconsistent, and arbitrary.  The FIND function/button has an entirely different function in the GPS section from the Palm section.  Of course, the same icon is used.  I cannot imagine grandma using this thing to navigate.  What little there is of the very pretty documentation is atrocious.  About 10 times more information is needed here.  It shuts down randomly on occasion for no apparent purpose (Battery savings maybe?).\n",
       "   The secure digital card is too small (max of 256MB), so you can't put more than a few California counties in the memory.  Maps storage is managed with a rather hostile GUI.  This is not fatal, but is irritating.  I would rather put a 1GB SD card in the iQue 3600 and be done with it.\n",
       "   The iQue 3600 burns too much power to be used as a portable, so it must always be tethered to the car or resting in the cradle.  I don't find the power issue to be a problem.  I understand that to get clear, bright screens it is necessary to use power.  I agree with the tradeoff here.\n",

       "Alright before I begin let me just say I know quite a bit about wireless networking.  I had already connected 2 wireless pc's to my 128 bit WEP encrypted router.  I had initially set it up as WPA but opted to change it as this hunk of junk doesn't support WPA.  This card will detect your network no problem, just try connecting to it.  Apparently I am typing in the wrong WEP pass.... I can assure you I am not.  Perhaps there is an issue between Micro$oft and D-link I am unaware of...go figure.  I do not have the time nor patience to deal with Micro$oft's customer support regarding this issue.  Back to the store this goes.  Do yourself a favour and do not buy this\n",

       "Microsoft has never failed to disappoint me, (I suppose there is something to be said for consistency) and this carries on that somewhat dubious tradition. I bought this with a the MN-700 wireless router, and both worked fine for a couple weeks. However, they both conspiratively proceeded to stop functioning. This card was the most maddening of the pair, because it would find the wireless network every once in a while, yet refuse to connect. I've tried every channel, and made sure its on infrastructure mode, but it still refuses to work. I suppose I deserve it, though, expecting that a microsoft wireless card would connect to a microsoft wireless router with a microsoft operating system. Do yourself a favor and buy your wireless networking from a decent company that has some expertise in networking, like Linksys or Belkin. Whatever you do, give as little money as possible to this shoddy company\n",

       "I just purchased this printer last night at BestBuy and took it home. When I removed the contents of the box, I noticed that the USB cord was not in there. I read the directions and said that you had to buy the cord separately. I couldn't believe it. So, I went to the store and bought one. This cost me an additional $11. I went home, installed the software and plugged everything in. I printed off a few things and it looked great. Today, I went to use the printer again and the power woudn't turn on! I disconnected then reconnected everything and still no power! I tried several more things and still couldn't turn the power on. Now I have to return it to BestBuy. This was the first and last time I will ever buy anything from HP!!\n",

       "However, the cord has ugly problems:\n",

       "2. The cord running to the right earphone is substantially longer than the one connecting to the left earphone. The result is annoying slack around the face and neck.\n",

       "I bought this TV for my husband to take hunting but we can't get very many channels and the ones we do get have a terrible picture.   The TV is an awesome size and the design is really nice with a good size screen.  I didn't hook to cable so that may improve the picture but we don't have cable.  I tried programming the channels from two different locations 20 miles apart from each other.  I tried programming with the antenna on the TV and with separate rabbit ears.   It would only pick up one of the three local network stations.  It picked up maybe 8 other misc stations which aren't popular.   I couldn't get a good picture on any of the stations and I tried adjusting all the menu items, brightness, hue, etc.  It didn't even have a good black and white picture .... it was like a white screen with blurry images in the back.   Sooooo, sooo disappointed because I wanted to be able to use this at work too. \n",

Those users who enjoy the backlight of a Mac PowerBook or MacBook Pro will be disappointed by the cheap approach Saitek used to illuminate the keys, though. On the Mac, each key has its own embedded light under the key. On the Saitek light is splashed under the entire keyboard, reducing the contrast and making it much harder to see the keys.  But it's better than nothing, and is helpful in low light. It would have also been nice if they had an Fn key, but such is life\n",

Except then I get an amber light that says there is a card error.  This is supposed to work with my all-in-one but it doesn't.  For that reason, I'd give it a zero star rating if such a rating existed.  I'm going to take this CP version back and hope the more updated CPF version works.  I'm a travel writer planning to take my own photos to go with my articles, but I'm getting nowhere fast with this card adapter that refuses to work properly.  This one is definitely a thumbs down.

The device recognized the card, but you could not copy, format, nothing... just got an error \"This card is read only and cannot be &lt;whatever&gt;.\"  Then all of a sudden it started working.  2 stars for the stress and for the fear that it will stop working again\n",

I am sure I am not alone since you can see these on that famous auction site may with similar power issues.  Customer service from this company is also very poor. If I had it to do over I would not have purchased this product and I probably should not have spent the money to get it fixed.

       "Cheap piece of junk. Probably has 2 cents of electronic parts in it. I'm returning it to Wallmart. It might work OK if you live like right next door to the broadcast transmitter. Otherwise it's just too weak in its signal pulling ability. Also, when I turn the gain dials, they don't seem like they are really variable. I think they are really just on/off switches disguised as variable dials, because i don't see any difference between medium gain and high gain on any of the channels. I'm going to now go to a REAL, serious electronics store and look for some SERIOUS tv electronics hardware instead of Wallmart garbage. I'm going to work on improving my roof antenna and its cabling and I'm going to try using a variable gain preamp if I can find one (a high quality one, not junk). I tried a preamp from Wallmart (which wasn't adjustable at all) and it did help a lot with UHF channels, but the VHF channels were much worse because it made the signal too strong. So I need a variable gain preamp, assuming there is such a thing. I would advise everyone to go read the information available on the internet about tv antennas and how to get the best picture with them. I did yesterday and there's a lot of good stuff I never knew before.\n",

       "Instead of just plugging it into the wall phone jack, you have to use a regular phone, route the receiver/handset cord to this, then back out to the receiver/handset again, which makes this light unit basically hamstrung between the headset and handset and doesn't want to sit on the desk without taping it down. Then you have to take the receiver/handset off the hook, place it on the desk (assuming you have desk space, which I don't) then push a button to start up the headset. \n",
       "\n",
       "Most importantly, listening sound quality was muffled and not very loud. If I turned up the incoming sound volume, it immediately put a loud annoying squeal of feedback into the microphone, making it totally unusable. \n",
       "\n",
       "I went back to my regular, unampflied Plantronics headset which just plugs into the wall phone and is always on with no extra cords, ac adapter, or buttons to push. I'm not very thrilled with that, but for $15 it sounds MUCH better and much louder, without the feedback or the hassles. So for now I guess I'll stick with that until I find something else that just improves the incoming sound\n",

It stopped printing and didn't recognize my HP-1200. After fiddling around with it for a few hours I finally got the contraption working again.\n",

I have to be within 10 feet of my router to get a 50% signal (even though I can walk out tot he edge of my house and easily still get a good connection). If it does detect Bluetooth, which half the time it doesn't (regardless of it being active), it cancels out the wifi detection. So if you have a bluetooth headset, and you're talking, the thing will just let you know that yes, there is a bluetooth device around. Thanks. I was wondering\n",

       "My husband bought me this for Christmas because we were moving to a new city. He picked it out because unlike Garmin and Magellen it was created from the ground up for use on the road. The features are easy to use, the directions are great and when you need a new route because of roadblock or traffic - it really comes up with a great plan. However - my first one lasted 3 months before it died, I then replaced it with another one and it died 3 months later as well. I was very reluctant to buy a different brand - but had to for dependability. I still don't like my Garmin as much - but at least it works. Come on Tomtom - get the electronics working as well as the maps and directions\n",

       "I'm a longtime user of Wacom Intuos tablets and I was looking for something similar with wireless capabilities for my new dual 2.5ghz-G5. There were no wireless Intuos products available at the time of purchase, so I went with the Graphire Bluetooth. Unfortunately, the product leaves a lot to be desired and after a couple of weeks of use, I plan on returning it. The major problem lies with the pen--both in design and responsiveness. \n",
       "\n",
       "Design: the Graphire series is cheaper than the Intuos, and there's a good reason why: the Graphire pen is thinner, lighter, and has no grip. If you have very small hands this might be acceptable; in my hand this feels like a toothpick. It's very difficult to manipulate a tool effectively when it doesn't feel like it has any durability. Additionally, the Graphire pen stand is little more than a piece of transparent molded plastic and slides around the desk whenever I put the pen back into it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Responsiveness: There is a half-second delay whenever using the pen to click in any finder-related options--opening windows, selecting files, etc. 1/2 second may sound acceptable, but if you, like me, use the pen for everything, not just drawing, believe me it is utterly maddening. On the other hand, the mouse behaves perfectly with no delay at all, so I know it's the pen and not my computer.\n",
       "\n",
       "The tablet is attractive and the mouse works fine, but the bottom line is that it's more important for me to have a responsive, durable pen than a wireless tablet. If you've never used an Intuos you may not recognize the deficiencies, but for those who have, this is like going from a Mercedes to a Honda Civic. You'll get better gas mileage with the Civic but the Benz gives you the  best overall driving experience. I need the driving experience, so I'm going back to the Intuos--wire and all.\n",

       "I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman\n",

Also, with an ADF flatbed, you can scan books, and unusual documents (thin paper, very heavy paper) that an ADF (and the ScanSnap) won't process by simply lifting the lid of the ADF and taking the scan directly on the glass.

       "We bought a set of these phones because they looked nice, and because AT&amp;T is a reliable company. But these phones are the worst. After having them for about 3 weeks, we began having terrible results with the volume/speakers in the phones. I took them back, and got a new set. These lasted about twice as long, before the battery life just became worthless. We are unable to leave these phones off the hook now for any extended period of time - say, 1 hour. And you can't talk on the phone for more than 30 minutes or so before the battery dies out, and takes 6 hours or more to get back charged again. And yes, we followed all the directions for letting the batteries charge, and all that kind of stuff. Still...I have never used a more frustrating phone, nor will I ever purchase an AT&amp;T phone again. I bought a new phone today, and once fully charged, I will take these AT&amp;T phones out back and smash them with a hammer\n",

I used my e-Trex Vista for about a year and half and would estimate that I spent 10% to 15% of the time staring at some type of lost signal message.  The unit is totally useless under any type of tree cover and often has trouble holding a signal anywhere on overcast days, which means about half the time in the Seattle area where I live.

       "Although at one point I was able to track 6 WAAS satellites and the display claimed accuracy to 17 feet, while driving along a straight road for 5.5 miles, it indicated that I was traveling approximately 350 feet to the side of the road.  On two occasions on this straight road, it said I actually crossed the road and traveled on the opposite side.\n",
       "\n",
       "I conducted a test by placing the unit where it would have an unobstructed view of the sky for 1 hour and leave it motionless.  The trip computer reported that it had moved nearly a quarter-mile during that hour.  I checked the accuracy at 15-minute intervals and it was constantly reporting accuracy between 12-24 feet.\n",

       "The base maps are crude and inaccurate - a major 4-lane road (Hwy 7) in Tacoma, WA stops at 38th street.  Really?!?  If I drive down Hwy 7, it goes a couple of miles farther than the unit shows.\n",
       "\n",
       "While using the compass you must hold the unit level in order to obtain accurate readings - understandable.  There is even a little message that tells you to hold it level if you are off a little - nice.  I tried and tried to find \"level\" according to the unit and after about 3 or 4 minutes was able to determine where \"level\" was.  It was nowhere close to actual level.  Now, if I am trying to navigate with the unit's compass while it is mounted to my bike, there is no way it is going to be level and accurate.\n",

The mere existence of a software layer to access the flash drive defeats the main purpose of existence of flash drives: a fast and higlhly compatible interface. Any hidrance to this convenience makes the device a liability. I work at an educational institution wher I am responsibel for organizing presentation sessions in which speakers often bring their presentations in a flash drive. As a matter of policy, we will not allow speakers to plug in to our computers devices that run any kind of software in the background\n",

I had almost given up on it and was actually shopping around for another USB drive that had no software on it, when I ran into a website that lets you download an uninstaller for the U3 Launch Pad. I downloaded it, ran it and it took no more than 15 seconds to clean out the offending U3 garbage! Now I like my Micro Cruzer all over again! Oh yeah... the website to uninstall yours at is: [...\n",

       "Having recently purchased a 25 unit spindle, I recently tried backing up several DVDs with my sony DRU-710A 16x DVD recorder.  Although the recording process initially did seem to work smoothly,  when I attemped to play back the disks recorded at 16x speed, I would have read errors and lockups on DVD players usually towards the end of the film (the outside of the physical disk, where maximum recording speed is obtained.)\n",
       "   I did have better reliability recording at 4x speed and suspect that 8x writes will work fine as well.  Given the fact that I paid a premium for this new high speed media, I am disappointed.  I have had nearly 100% reliability with Memorex 8x DVD+R, recently making 25 successful recordings in a row with this brand (ASIN: B0001MKU4S\n",

I sent the unit back for repair.  They claimed to have \"fixed it\" but when I received it back it STILL failed on each disc (note that these failures RUIN the disc!).  They sent  me a brand new unit.  GUESS WHAT..?!   It failed after 3 months with the SAME PROBLEM!!  I sent it back for repairs.   AGAIN they claimed to have \"fixed it\".  Well,  it malfunctioned IMMEDIATELY!! I sent it back AGAIN!! This time they gave me a refurbished unit. I know you wont believe this...but the unit is WORSE than the other two!!  They are currently sending me ANOTHER new unit.  But I have no doubt this one will STILL be a piece of crap.  They simply don't have this technology down. SONY should NEVER have put this junk on the market. BEWARE!!\n",

Please note these positive reviews are from buyer who had their units for two weeks or similar time periods.   I have had four different units for ONE YEAR and can tell you THIS IS JUNK!

I cannot calculate how many hours I have spent trying to figure out what is wrong. No loading, skipping, freezing, not OPENING when it freezes, all down the line, combined with 100 trips to and from the video stores to exchange their \"defective\" DVDs. My wife was firmly of the belief the DVDs were just \"dirty\" but I finally decided (this agrees with one of the reviewers) there is a balance problem in the drawer. When there is a no-load, jiggling/adjusting the drawer sometimes (not always) fixes it, but only until the next time, and will not stop the freezing problems. If my wife had a dime for every time I said \"this thing is a piece of @&amp;*!\" she would be a millionaire. This is very late but if this product is still on the market in ANY form stay many miles away. And Philips' arrogant lack of response (as reported; I have no personal experience here) is virtually criminal in this day and age\n",

       "For some years I tried this and other Monster products, to the tune of over $1000 in Monster a/v gear. The more you learn about video and audio, the more you'll avoid anything with the Monster label. Specifically, this s-video meets no NTSC, DVD or IEEE standard; it is common 30-ohm hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed, low-conductance connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding. Has a sharp image, but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from off-color skin tones to color blotching, dirty grays, burned highlights, murky shadows, noisy reds, and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds. Makes video test patterns look great, but who watches test patterns all day? Amazon offers many other brands at good prices, why waste your $$ on this stuff? I removed every piece of Monster from my system and replaced them with AR, Belden, Viewsonics and others from Amazon. Result: vast improvement in every respect.\n",

       " Cowon aka iAudio have the worst customer service of any other major company I dealt with. No phone support, they have an 800 number but when you call it they direct you to their website. Their website support gives you the option to submit a ticket or Live Chat. I waited over an hour on their Live Chat before I get a message saying that Live Chat is not available at this time. I submitted a ticket &amp; guess how long before I heard a response. &amp; the response was \"ship the item back for a refund\". I also tried to download the latest firmware and the link was broken. I heard a lot about how bad their customer service was, but when I tried it myself it was even worse\n",

In one year, I have replaced this machine THREE TIMES.  All three times, I got error messages that the toner cartridge was out (Toner Life End) even when new toner cartridges were put in.  I do give high marks to Brother for its customer service, though.  Each time I had a problem, I called and they sent out a replacement by FedEx along with materials for me to send back the broken one.  But when the fourth replacement arrived last week and I turned it on and got an immediate paper jam message, I had enough.  I had a similar issue with a Brother mutlifunction machine I purchased around the same time.  I am done with Brother products\n",

       "I purchased this for my Intel iMac mainly because I was so frustrated with the Mighty Mouse.  I wanted something with two separate buttons.  I had tried the Logitech MX 610 (which I purchased as well for another computer) and thought that the ergonomic shape felt wonderful.  So, I purchased this desktop set because I wanted it to match my Mac and so I could have a proper 2 button mouse.  I figured the Mac keyboard could use improvement as well so the keyboard could come in handy as well.  In fact, I thought I would get added convenience since this was a keyboard designed for a Mac and had extra shortcut buttons.\n",
       "\n",
       "Other than having 2 separate buttons on the mouse, this keyboard/mouse combo has been an utter disappointment.\n",
       "\n",
       "First of all, the white doesn't quite match.  It's close, but just a touch too cream.  Also, there's just too much silver.  Especially on the mouse.\n",
       "\n",
       "Secondly, it doesn't have all the buttons the Mighty Mouse does.  There is no button to switch to the Widgets.  Luckily, you can press F12 on the keyboard.  Not quite as convenient, but still possible.  However, I have yet to find a button that allows you to switch between various open programs.  This is especially necessary if you have multiple web browsers open.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thirdly, this mouse just doesn't work as well as other Logitechs.  It is too light, lacking the \"feel\" and a bit of the comforting weight that the MX 610 has when you move it around.  Also, the speed of the cursor is off.  No matter how I try to adjust the speed, it doesn't quite match the speed of the original Mighty Mouse.  It is either too fast or too slow.  I think part of it is simply OSX's lack of adjustability compared to [gasp] Windows for cursor speed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, the keyboard is simply atrocious.  I don't even use it anymore.  It's packed up in the box and I plugged the original Mac keyboard back in.  The keys make a horrendous clatter when typing.  The pressure is nonexistant making touch typing just a bit more difficult than normal.  Also, the depth is quite shallow.  This is a desktop keyboard.  You can press the key down further on nearly all the laptop keyboards I've tried.  Also, the texture of the keys is far too smooth and uniform.  The raised dots to help you find the F or J buttons is too shallow.  I can't find the asdf an jkl; rows by touch.  I have to look.  As a touch typist, this is an unforgiveable sin.  It basically transforms you from a touch typist to a hunt and peck typer who has to visually find each key before you can hit it.  I'm typing on a Thinkpad whose laptop keyboard is far superior to this Logitech.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, in short, save your money and avoid this keyboard/mouse combo.  I rated it a two because the mouse did have 2 separate buttons, unlike the Mighty Mouse, which is why I purchased this in the first place.  It hit my most basic requirement.  Otherwise, it really deserves a 1 star rating\n",

       "I bought this unit because a DLink Sales Rep said it would be perfect for my application. Hah! It doesn't work at all (I hope Amazon will let me return it). The first thing I had to do was upgrade the firmware - no instructions on how to do this, but for the uninitiated: you have to download the .ftp file from Dlink, move it to the Dlink Firmware folder on your computer, then get the AP Manager to see your unit (that's another story involving IP addresses - again, no help from the install documents), and then you can install the update. I finally got the DWL-2100AP to see my network, but never could get it to talk back - it just sent gibberish. The Net tech and I worked on it for most of two working days, to no avail. Spent a lot of time on the phone with the DLink tech staff too, where everyone involved said we got some bad dope from the sales staff, but that we might get it to work, provided it is compatible with the existing equipment blah, blah, blah... My assessment of Dlink and the DLINK DWL-2100AP? Poor pre-sales support, poor post-sales support, confusing tech support, and poor documentation/install instruction for a product that may be (but then again, may not be) compatible with your existing equipment. What's up DLink\n",

Just so you know,my system is running a pentium 4 processor and has 8 active USB 2.0 connections, only 3 of which are being used for the keyboard, mouse, and this webcam, along with 512MB of RAM which is more than necessary for this product to function.\n",
       "\n",
       "The software took about 10 minutes to install which I thought was a little odd, then it askes for you to plug in the camera.  My XP system recognized the camera but told me that the hardware had encountered an error during installation and may not function properly.  I uninstalled the software and tried the installation again with the same result.  I then tried a different USB port just in case there was a problem.  Following a stepwise process I checked and updated all drivers for the USB hub, ports, etc. and I checked under the system manager tools to ensure that all were working properly.  I then went to the microsoft website and downloaded the updates for the software (this took another 15 minutes and the site crashed twice).\n",

       "By now I was getting very frustrated but hoped that the software update would allow appropriate conectivity with the camera.  I went into the software and found that it was recognizing the mic, but it said that there was no camera attached.  I again tried to find the camera through other means with no results.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the price paid and the 3+ hours I spent trying to install the hardware I can say with all assurity that this product is not worth it.  I will be returning it to Target for a full refund and will look into investing my money with another brand.\n",

       "In terms of sound quality, noise cancelling, and general comfort - thise headphones are top of the line. I absolutely love the way the sound and the ammount of noise cancelling that they provide. I used them regularly when mowing the lawn and when flying, and I always recieved the highest quality sound and noise cancelleation. I was even able to listen to drum-n-bass while mowing the lawn and hear all of the appropriate frequencies on the low end. \n",
       "\n",
       "However... inside of 6 months, I have gone through 2 pairs of these headphones because the right ear headphone has gone out on them. The worst part is - I can't even begin to imagine why it goes out. I keep my heaphones in a locked cabinet in my office every night. Last friday, I placed back into the nice little carry bag that they come with, and placed them into this cabinet. This morning when I pulled them out for use, the right ear bud is out again... no physical damage is apparent anywhere on the headphones, and there is not a broken wire anywhere. In fact, the wiring is perfectly fine and still functional. It is the physical earbud - the hard plastic peice - that has gone out. If i squeeze the earbud hard enough, it will turn on again. \n",

       "Something inside of the earbud is obviously designed improperly and I would highly recommend that noone purchase these headphones because of this\n",

Then I set up the network settings with my router and scanned for the access point (Infrastructure) but it couldn't find anything even though the router was only 5-7 feet away! At one point it managed to connect to the router but it was still searching for the internet connectivity.. After several minutes it couldn't find anything and disconnected from the router.

The wireless caused 90% of my communication problems.  Ran a wire and things were fine.  Clock could not keep time for anything.  Set USA EDT and it was fine and shortly after it feel back one hour.  D-Link knows of this and the only solution was to use Atlantic time.  It has all the right features and image is great but I have to vote thumbs down on this unit.\n",

However, when I received the speakers I found that they are much larger in size and much lower in both quality of build and quality of sound than for example the Creative speakers. They have a huge and unstable footprint when opened (about 9 inches long and one inch deep) and are not particularly compact when folded either. The sound is not rich and they eat batteries amazingly fast, then begin to buzz. I do not recommend these speakers\n",

Its impossible to use in Park and Neutral in my car. The controls are bulky.  The transmission cut out in mountains, on hills, and on the highway whenever I drove over 60mph resulting in my ipod starting and stopping because it shakes and wobbles in the console.  In short, it hardly worked and I was afraid to touch it while driving, lest I'd knock my gear shift out of place. Its cheaply made and all in all a complete piece of junk.\n",

It's not that easy - you have to stick your finger into the cassette slot while the adapter is in there, and wiggle it forward and backward until the audio adjusts.  But that doesn't always work.  If that doesn't work, you then have to turn your hand over and use your fingernail to catch a ridge on the adapter and lift it up a bit.  I'd rather not have an accident on the highway by either (1) fiddling with the audio, or (2) smashing the adapter into little pieces while I drive.\n",

       "Yesterday was the annual Thanksgiving sale day. I got this 1G CF card from Staples by $40 after easy rebate. With this price, I think it is a great deal. However, it worked for my digital rebel only half an hour before it was DEAD. All my photos in the card were lost. I am a graduate student majoring in computer engineering, I know how to recover data if a hard drive fails. But this time, I find I simply can't help. Fortunately, Staples have a good return policy and I just returned it without hassle. Hopefully, this is only my case. My suggestion: make sure your dealer has a good return policy before you get this item. \n",

This happens a couple of times a week, but of course at the most inconvenient times.\n",

The mouse will wake up after a slight delay and I'm used to that but I can't tell you how many times I pressed \"Ctrl-C\" to copy something into the buffer and then discovered that it didn't \"take\" because the keyboard was asleep.  The keyboard should never go to sleep or this \"feature\" should have a way to be disabled!\n",
       "\n",
       "4) The keyboard died (stopped responding) at less than 6 months old.  I still use the mouse but dug out an ancient Dell quietkey wired keyboard.  Frankly I don't miss the behemoth MS monster at all, at least the old keyboard doesn't take up the whole desk and when I hit Ctrl-C it works every time.\n",

       "Speaking from real experience, don't waste your money buying this cable which makes absolutely no difference from a cabe you can find with half or less the price. I bought a few top of the line monster cables once I got the top of the line SONY XBR960 HDTV. Later on I switched cables around, with other brand, cheaper component cables such as Philips PTS1000 (the HDMI standard owner by the way), and also other HDMI cables (even no name brands coming with my DVD player). You know what? I see absolutely no difference even under close examination. The SONY XBR960 produces the finest pitch you can find on any TV. You think about what that means. Stop buying this ridiculously priced cables, and save your $$ and buy somethinfg else on your shopping list. Digital is digital. Don't let monster mislead you that their cables produce more 11010 ... than others.\n",

If you've heard of it, you know what I'm talking about).  I was told that the warranty did not cover what was wrong with my video camera (some ambiguous statement about logic board, power unit, etc. failure followed), and would have to pay ~$780 to have it fixed.  I naturally refused, and was forced to keep my dead 4 month-old handycam, an unfortunate testament to some of Sony's now widely publicized QC issues.  The reason I did not send in the camera initially has to do with the fiasco involving my CD player.  I was told, explicitly, that if NEW could not fix it, they would either return the unit or write me a check in the amount of $1,000 (not even enough to cover the cost of the player).  As an added insult, when they indeed could not fix the unit, they KEPT it, and I NEVER received a check!!!  Simply outrageous!  Blatant theft, and I'm not the only one who will tell you a story about NEW and such an act.  They are IMPOSSIBLE to get ahold of, and literally take your money and run/disappear.  Don't expect to ever hear from them, should your camera stop working, and good luck getting ahold of them if you happen to send it in beforehand.  Chances are, you will have to eat the loss, as I did.  This product deserves a negative star and should come with an automatic refund.  I seriously thought it was a gag when I saw NEW was in charge of the coverage.  What a joke!  Whoever runs your company, NEW, ought to be both ashamed of themselves and held liable for all the countless damages and losses they have caused.  The whole lot of you belong in an unfriendly prison\n",

       "I originally placed my order with my a digital camera and this four year service plan. Three days after, I had to cancel my digital camera order for personal reasons. However the $161.80 total I spent on this warrant did not refund automatically and nor have I received a confirmation that it will be refunded. After several phone calls and emails of providing information for the requested refund. They finally tell me that it will take 8 weeks for my refund to process. That is two whole months. Horrible service I can't imagine how long it would take for them to either repair or replace my camera should it have faltered. I would not recommend this four year service plan or any other plan by N.E.W. Customer Service Companies to anyone\n",

       "It looked flashy and well-conceived on the web shopping sites that featured it; however, after setting up Panasonic's KX-TG5576M, I'm underwhelmed...    First of all, even in this day and age, it's not Mac-compatible (though the Pansonic Call Center Representative had assured me, after checking with her Superior, that it indeed was.)   So,  I cannot comment on downloading ringtones, wallpapers, etc.   (Meanwhile, these mobile phone-like features were the main reason I wanted this particular cordless phone).\n",
       "\n",
       "Secondly, the built in digital message recorder is of the lowest quality.   I was looking for an alternative to the monthly charge for voice mail through the phone company.    This isn't it. If you prefer to record your own message in lieu of the generic built-in message options, your Callers will here something sounding like a worn-out Edison recording.   It struck me as odd that with the included audio cable, you can connect the handset to an audio device with a headphone jack, to record custom ring tones, with good quality results.  Yet, to record a message for the digital answering machine, you need to speak into the dinky little microphone hole on the base unit, with the aforementioned low sound quality.  \n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, the battery life of the handset is rather short.  This is despite the (too) low backlighting on the handset keypad.  Oh, why no backlighting on the base unit? \n",

       "I cannot recommend HP to anybody anymore. The company introduced regional coding, which means printer cartridges from one region cannot be used in another. For most this is probably not an issue, for those busily traveling around it is. Also, it is an issue of principle, its bad enough for DVD, but printer cartridges? HP has introduced this rather secretely and if you don't read the box cover etc very carefully, you may not notice. The main issue is in Europe. I got caught out. I bought a 3 catridges overseas - I could not use them on my HP printer. I asked for a refund, HP Email Support (US) was nice but ineffective. HP Customer Support (Europe) was snotty and very rude. I think HP does not care about its customers and this cost me over US$75, almost 50% of my printer (my sixth and last HP). Don't buy HP\n",

       "If your cars Dash is curved or sloping, this mount will not work. Did not work on a 1988 Mercedes 300E or a Daewoo Lanos. It might work if you have a perfectly FLAT dash. I had to return the item as it did not sit properly. Even the slightest touch from a finger would make it slide down. Those of you who are clean freaks like me, BEWARE. Products like armour all which leave a protective coating on your dash will further reduce the grip of this stand! I would not trust a $800 piece of equipment on an unreliable stand like this when even a slight touch of a finger can make it slide down. What about jolts and bumps while normal driving? I did not wait to find out using my $800 GPS as an experiment\n",

The powerline etherernet works flawlessly, I've had it up and running for six months without restart or problem into three other rooms.  The wireless module however tends to overheat and drops the network after 24-48 hours of operation, so she has to unplug it every time she is done with the network, and plugs it back in whenever she wants to connect.  I am going to upgrade her to another wired powerline ethernet module\n",

       "I posted a review two weeks ago, but it hasn't appeared, so I'm trying again...I bought this lock two years ago.  It has always been difficult to remove.  (Note:  despite what some other reviewers seem to think, it does NOT have a motion detector - that's a different lock.)  Recently, the lock decided to remain firmly inside my iBook, despite my efforts to remove it.  After a fruitless call to Targus's customer support, I finally got it out.  That took over 30 minutes of struggle.  My next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw.  Apparently, the Targus lock is not a good fit for iBooks.  I'm going to send mine back and demand compensation.  If you own an iBook, I strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than Targus\n",

       "We drink a lot of coffee all day, every day.  So we decided to convert to a thermal carafe coffeemaker in order to keep our coffee hotter and fresher-tasting.  We first bought the 10-cup Capresso MT-500 which we loved except for the carafe which leaked slightly.  The coffee was perfect everytime and the taste great.  Unfortunately the control panel burned out about a year and half after we bought it.  So instead of another expensive Capresso replacement, we decided to try a Japanese model which we thought might be more reliable.  We have been using the Zojirushi for 2 weeks now and it works perfectly.  No leaks and it just feels more mechanically reliable than the Capresso.  Unfortunately, there is no water filter system in this model compared to others (we had taken this for granted and not checked for it).  And no reuseable metal mesh filter (that I could find on the market) instead of paper filters.  The water also does not seem as hot when it goes into the coffee grounds.  We are not sure why our coffee just doesn't taste very good anymore, but we definitely have noted a real sharp drop in taste quality.  Today, we pulled out our very old Krups ProAroma model and have noted a definite taste improvement.  We will use this and the Zojirushi thermal carafe until we get a new Capresso coffeemaker replacement.  Don't waste your money on this Zojirushi model unless you don't care about taste.  It was money thrown out the window as far as we are concerned.  Even mediocre coffee beans are too expensive to use with this machine\n",

       "\n",
       "The audio listening quality is poor, especially for 40mm drivers (which normally sound good with strong bass response).  This is due to the fact the speaker itself is far from the ear canal, since the outer padding contacts the side of the head instead of the actual speaker pad.\n",
       "\n",
       "The headphones are heavy, which means a large amount of pressure is required to hold them in position.  They slide very easily off the head, and apply a lot of downward force on the ears.  I have a big head, and even made some slight modifications that increase the pressure, now they don't slide off, but are uncomfortable for more than an hour of use.\n",
       "\n",
       "At first, the volume slider is stiff, but then becomes smooth.\n",
       "\n",
       "After 4 months of use, the mute switch is getting loose, I don't expect it to work 4 months from now.\n",
       "\n",
       "I really like the microphone portion of the headset, the angle is adjustable, and the volume is loud and clear.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the end, these headphones have a good microphone matched with very poor quality headphones.  Next time, I'd grab the cheaper Logitech headset, where they are nice and light and the speaker pads make contact with the ears, not some large outer pad\n",

       "I purchased this unit not for gaming, but for making PC to PC calls.  Here are my observations:\n",
       "\n",
       "Pros:  \n",
       "1. Sound quality of the microphone on the receiving end is reported by my friends and family as exceptionally clear.  Certainly much better than what you'd get out of a webcam.\n",
       "2. Chord is robust and long.  Easily fits over my long desk to my CPU that rests beneath.\n",
       "3. Controls are easy to use, although the mic on/off switch doesn't click into place like I'd expect it to.  It just slides back and forth.  I can see people accidentally turning it off.\n",
       "4. Headphones produce good sound, although nothing extraordinary.\n",
       "5. The mic itself freely rotates, so you can position it however you desire.\n",
       "\n",
       "Cons:\n",
       "1. First and foremost, if you've got a small head DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!!  My head is not big and these headphones ARE NOT ADJUSTABLE!  These headphones are so large that they're actually uncomfortable.  Their entire weight rests on my ears and I can't wear them for very long without my ears falling off.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  These headphones are very heavy, uncomfortably so.  I've resorted to holding them up to my head and listening through one speaker to take the weight off my ears.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  Perhaps having the airspace between the speakers and the frame keeps your ears cooler, but it still feels like I'm wearing a set of insulated ear muffs.  Chatting on hot summer days is limited to 10 minutes or less until I'm dying of heat exhaustion.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. You need to get a Y splitter if you wish to have these headphones and your computer speakers on at the same time. If you don't have front headphone plugs on your case this is an issue.  Otherwise you have to crawl under your desk and manually disconnect the headset from your motherboard jacks and plug in your speakers again.  Y splitters are only a few dollars but it's an accessory you will have to purchase, especially since front speaker ports on most computers can't be hooked up at the same time as your rear motherboard jack (and most people have their main sound systems plugged in with the rear one). Granted, this is more of a general microphone/headset combo issue than anything Logitek related, but if this is your first microphone/headset purchase then you should be aware of this problem.  I use onboard audio instead of a sound card, so I don't have multiple output jacks.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. These headphones are designed to rest behind your neck, not over the top of your head.  Unfortunately, the plastic beam is too heavy and pulls the speakers back, placing all the weight on your ears.  The plastic beam is also too short (and just!) to go over the top of my head for a more comfortable fit.\n",
       "  \n",
       "6. The design also doesn't make sense.  The beam is so short that it should rest behind your neck, yet the angle of the speakers through that air gap is better for wearing the beam over your head.  It's pretty uncomfortable.  If the headset was adjustable it would be fine!  The earpieces are just too huge!\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall I'm disappointed with these.  If you're under 5'10\" I say go with another model.  The hardware works great, but the design is terrible.  I'm returning these and purchasing an uglier, but more functional, set of smaller headphones\n",

       "I have been using the Palmone Navigator with my TX for about eight weeks.  Most of my comments are based on a comparison with the built-in navigation system in my Lexus.  \n",
       "\n",
       "Software installation is fairly easy.  However, you need at least a 256 MB SD card to load more than a couple of states; I recommend a 1 or 2 GB card.  \n",
       "\n",
       "While the concept of a TX doubling as a navigation device is intriguing, the realty of it is rather sobering.  It is a cool toy, but if you have to plan routes for your job or any other meaningful purpose, this is NOT the right product.  \n",
       "\n",
       "The pros are:\n",
       " - Inexpensive in comparison to built-ins und stand-alone products\n",
       " - Unit can be used in different locations and cars and even while walking\n",
       " - One device serves multiple purposes\n",
       "\n",
       "The cons are:\n",
       " - It can take up to several minutes after starting the unit to acquire a satellite signal.  This is not the case with my car's OEM navigation system.\n",
       " - The maps are outdated and not as precise as the OEM nav system:  I live in Phoenix, AZ and my neighborhood (built seven years ago) as well as most of the freeways I take to work and back don't exist on the software.  More recent updates are not available (I checked the Tomtom website).\n",
       " - Navigation is often not precise enough (e.g. it tells me to make a left in 50 yards, when I have already passed the intersection where it wants me to make a left).  I never have this problem with the built-in navigation.\n",
       " - Look-up function for addresses and phone numbers is clumsy and doesn't display actual address until you map it.\n",
       " - It tends to freeze at least a couple times a day, requiring a soft reset.  \n",
       " - Lost connections to the satellite receiver or lost satellite signals also tend to disrupt the navigation on longer trips with stops.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, the unit is too unreliable to be used as your only navigational aid.  If you need navigation to get to your travel destination, you are better off with a stand-alone unit.  I truly wish I had better things to say about this device since I really like the concept, but the reality just doesn't match the marketing.\n",

I can play all of the songs that I owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled. I've done a little research about the disappearing MP3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the H10's and 1 other model I can't remember right now and iRiver can't figure it out; although I've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug....So buy with caution.... \n",

       "For over eight years (nearly 9), I had an Acer 17\" CRT &amp; loved it. I use a KVM to switch computers, &amp; the CRT kept all of my adjustments for that computer, every time.\n",

       "I swap between ME &amp; XP, which shouldn't matter.\n",

       "\n",
       "Fade out: I have the monitor, at the \"proper\" height, &amp; the upper &amp; lower corners fade. As looking at any lcd from an angle.\n",

       "I bought this printer because I wanted high quality photo printing and I didn't need any of the bells and whistles that come with more expensive printers. It's a Canon, so I figured I could count on the photo quality. I was terribly disappointed though. I generally buy Staples brand photo paper for general photo printing, and it always worked fine with my Epson printer. But my first prints on this printer looked dull and muddy -- like I was looking at the images though a mild but annoying grey/brown haze. So I went out and bought Canon paper instead. The quality was somewhat improved, but still not what I had expected. So yes, I got a printer for under $30, but now to get even passably OK prints, I need to spend a fortune on Canon brand inks and paper. Not much of a bargain.\n",

Played everything I put in it until a few days ago, when it started having intermittent problems- graphics were staticy and blocky, sound would just buzz and it wouldn't eject discs until I shut it down and restarted it. That lasted for two days before the problem became permanent. Now it's a doorstop.

My thoughts were that is I was going to dive into the ipod experience I should invest in a quality case to protect it. I'm sure that most people would think the way I do. I read the reviews and felt that even though it was a little pricey I would go ahead. This product is not a good one for the price. Mine broke, specifically, the plastic slider on the side that locks the shuffle in. I know what your thinking... she abused the product but I swear I did not. I loathe returning things but, darn it, this is ridiculous. Avoid this one and go for something less expensive.\n",

       "I adore my nano, but this armband is one of the worst products I have ever bought.  I work out quite a bit with the nano and the band comes off multiple times during my workout.  The spacing of the velcro dots means I never get exactly the right fit and the band gets ripped off anytime I do weight lifting close to my body.    It is also as other reviewers mentioned hugely overpriced for what it is.  I am ordering a band from a different company and this will go straight to the garbage.\n",

Even worse is any activity that requires me to flex my biceps at all, so lifting weights is out.  Put it on too tight, and I constrict the muscle.  Loosen it a little, and the band slips off.  There is no happy medium.  Also, the earphone cord gets in the way more when it's leading from my arm.\n",

Amazon was very gracious about their return policy and I was quickly sent a new phone free of charge.  Well, the second phone does the same thing and I'm returning it to get a refund.

       "I can't say enough positive about Logitech mice.  This device, however, was a dismal disappointment.  The PC interface works well, and its knowledge of existing components seems impressive.  Unfortunately, that in no way translates into a good remote interface.  The ability of the unit to reliably turn on multiple components was poor, and, for those with video recorder boxes, very important functionality like the ability to access or schedule recording lists is not readily available (if its there at all, its hidden many keystrokes deeper than I care to know about).  Even when reverting to manual operation of individual components, changing which device is being accessed involves two keystrokes (as opposed to just one on less complex universal remotes--a much more irritating trait than one might think).  Overall, for day-to-day functionality I actually consider the barely-programmable remote that came with my Scientific Atlanta DVR vastly superior to the Harmony, which I've given up on after only a few days of forced use.\n",

       "I have 2 10 year old natural keyboards with the old keyboard layout and when I saw this new keyboard with the same layout I bought one.  Sadly, this keyboard is painful to use.  The keys - especially the space bar - require far more force to use that my previous keyboard.  I am a software engineer and used to typing but this keyboard has slowed my typing rate and wears me out after 20 minutes.  On the shelf it goes for emergencies as I'll continue to maintain my old keyboard\n",

You will have to use \"add to file\" function and select all scan parameters again. There is no option to scan double-sided pages as well with using 2 pass scanning. So 3rd party software is definitively needed to get a real value out of ADF scanning.\n",

I have an average size head and even fully extended to put them on you have to warp the headband to the point that it looks like its about to break.

Only complaint is the cumbersome battery case and cheap feeling plastic construction. However, none of this mattered when it just stopped working 4 months after purchase.

There are other reviewers here that shared my same fate, so if you want to gamble with these, go ahead, but know that the risk is a pair of dead headphones. \n",

       "This was my first set of in-ear headphones and I bought them because they are cheap.  Well, you get what you pay for.  Being disappointed with the fit of the Koss phones, I bought the slightly more expensive JVC HA-FX55V.  At least for me, a much better fit, which means more comfort and better sound.  And I am still shopping.  The array of offerings is daunting:  JVC and JPlug at about $20 all the way up to Shure's top of the line at $500.  So shop around, but forget about the Koss\n",

       "This warranty is purchased through Amazon, but it is actually distributed by another company.  When you search for TV warranties on Amazon, you will see 4 warranties that appear to be the same, but are different prices.  I called the company that sells these warranties and asked what the difference was.  They told me that there is no difference between the $119 warranty and the $499 warranty; they cover the exact same thing.  The girl I spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference.  Warranties are a tricky item to review, because it all looks good until you actually need it.  So, on this one, I suppose only time will tell.  The one difference between the Amazon warranty and the electronic store warranty is that the Amazon one will not replace the first bulb in the TV; but I figure if I need to replace the bulb within those four years I will still be saving $100 because I can get a new bulb for around $200.\n",

       "Bought this as a back-up for the internal hard drive of the laptop. My experience was sadly similar to  many others on this site. Worked fine for two backups, then the drive stopped being recognized by my own or any other computer. Little red \"power\" light is on, little disc whirls around, but no blue \"data transmit\" light appears anymore. These are clearly a dismally unreliable and poorly made product- just imagine the disaster if this occurred when you were trying to restore data to a corrupted hard drive on your primary machine. A free replacement would not be much of a compensation. Avoid!!\n",

       "The iPod is cool but ours ... as we've found has happened to many other owners ... went on the fritz and our nightmare began. Apple's customer service is the worst CS that we've ever experienced regardless of the product or service supported. I could write for days about the awful experience but I've wasted so much time with them already ... I can't bear to waste more. The most notable point is that the iPod CS folks repeatedly stated that iPods are more or less disposable, commodity items and \"breakdowns\" were common. Wow!! .. $400 Bucks of throw away!?!?!? We still haven't recieved the return box for replacement/repair after several days even though it was promised in 24-48 hours. We also own an MP3 player that we refer to as a \"Dell-Pod\" from Dell Computer and have had to use their customer service as well. Dell's CS support was awesome. Based on our experience with Apple/iPod CS support ... this is the first and LAST Apple product that will be owned in our household\n",

       "I purchased this item on Nov. 17, 2006.  Amazon claimed it was in stock.  I then upgraded from free shipping to Standard, which promises a 3-5 days delivery time.  Amazon now informs me that it will arrived on Nov. 29th! This is the second recent order with a longer than anticipated/promised delivery time.  I don't know if Amazon is going down hill or what, but it's discouraging.  Next time, I'll just buy the item locally and pay a few extra dollars.  And by the way, don't even try to call Amazon Customer Service at 800-201-7575.  They can't do anything to resolve a problem and barely speak or understand English.  Another great American company moving towards metiocracy; what a shame\n",

There are no instructions within the packaging that state how to watch Non-region 1 DVDs.  I called the manufacturer and they told me how to \"rigg\" it to play region 2 DVDs.  Also, the remote control did not work from the very beginning and the manufacturer said I would need to pay money to replace it.  They also let me know that the DVD player will not work without the remote control (not compatible with universal remotes).  This is not a good product\n",

I videotape my sons basketball games for their coaches and it was only after the first couple of games and bad recordings that I got onto Canon's website and realized my video head was clogged.  I purchased a head cleaner and the first tape after the cleaning taped great, but the next tape clogged my head up, so to use these tapes, I highly recommend you clean your video head after EACH use, which is not good for your video head on your camcorder\n",

       "The features, size, and design of this unit are what drew me in. But after just a few uses, I quickly came to realize that this was nothing more than cheap electronics wrapped up in an attractive, but completely unusable package. To start with, the unit is small - the smallest of its kind. But the bulky external mic makes the overall footprint just as large as some of the palmtop units that this was made to replace. Second, the unit has a built-in rechargeable battery that cannot be removed. So, when it crashes, which it does frequently, there is no way to \"cold-boot\" the unit by removing the battery. This is also a problem because it reduces the unit's true portability because you can easily get stuck with no remaining battery life and no AC power to recharge it. Then, what you have is a paperweight. Oh, and by the way, when you do have it plugged in to charge, the backlight is always on (even if the power is off). So forget about using this unit as a plugged in desktop recorder either.\n",
       "\n",
       "But, all of this aside, the firmware simply does not work. It locks up incessantly and, with no way to reboot, you literally have to unplug it, wait for it to auto-power-off, and hope that you can start the machine up again. And, to add insult to injury, the body is a cheap Chinese-made piece of plastic with absolutely no meat on its bones.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, don't be taken in by the low price. Paying any amount of money is too much for a unit that doesn't work\n",

       "Run WinXP, sp2 with everything updated.  I've had this router for 6 months.  It is the WGT624v3, firmware updated.  I never realized how bad the wireless was on this router until this week - dropped connetion 3 times in 15 minutes today alone, while reading the Amazon.com reviews.  \n",
       "My desktop PC's  graphics card went down this past week and I had to RMA it... so about 10 days to send out and get a return.  I have always used a wired connection for my home desktops.  The wireless access was a 'it's there if I need it' novelty.  I started brining my IBM R51 laptop home from work so I could get online, VPN into work, etc..  This is the first time I have used my wireless consistently for more than a hour or so.\n",
       "The last 10 days have been rediculous to say the least.  I logged on my first day and lost connection 5-6 times browsing MSN and Yahoo.  At first I thought it might be channel interference since 2 other routers in range were using channel 11.  I went ahead and disabled the 108G feature since I had never come close to hitting that speed anyways, and changed the channel..  I used the IBM ThinkVantage software to scan my area for other wireless routers and picked a channel not being used.  I changed channels and I verified my signal strength before and after I changed, 95% signal strength. The connection is still getting dropped randomly.  Changed channel to another channel not being used in my area and verified signal strength.  No difference.  Scanned the networks again using the IBM ThinkVantage software.. theres my router, 97% signal strength @ 54Mbs.  unplugged router, modem, repaired my WINSOCKS with WinsockXP, rebooted PC.  I turned on my modem first until is was ready to go, then the router until it was ready, and then my PC (as per the netgear website)and yea, no difference in the connections stability.  The conection is still getting dropped randomly.  \n",
       "I might expect this from a router thats on all the time and is getting tired from constantly being hammered. But I hardly ever used the wireless access (yes, wireless radio has been OFF).  After reading these reviews, I am pretty sure the problem wont go away.  \n",
       "The part that upsets me the most, I payed premium money for a product that I thought was premium.  If this had been priced (at the time) at bargain bin prices, I wouldn't of cared.. but it wasn't and i do.  The 'you get what you pay for' saying does not hold true for this product. \n",

       "I wanted to connect a computer to a router, and the computer was going to be pretty far away from the router.  So I figured I needed a long cord, and decided to get this one, which is supposed to be cat 5 stranded patch (which was what I needed.)  Well, it's long.  That's the only good thing about this cord.  But the bad thing is so bad that the cord is useless.  There is nothing on the ends!  It's just a giant wire!  There aren't any connectors on the ends that I can use to plug the cord into my computer, or the router.  So I have a cord, but no connectors.  It's completely useless, unless I buy the connectors separately, and attach them myself.  Do I know how to do that?  Do I want to do that?  No.   So I'm returning this.  Maybe, if all you need is the cord (it's grey, by the way), and not the connectors, you might be able to use this.  Otherwise, it's completely useless.  If you can't find any cords this long that have connectors, maybe you should consider trying a shorter cord.  ..\n",

       "I have really enjoyed my I pod until I started to get errors in January 2006. I started to get an error that state that Itunes can't read to or write form the Disk meaning the Ipod itself. That means I cannot add music to or take music off of the Iopd. This was very upsetting to me as I have had this item for less than a year. I Finlay called tech support at Apple. They asked for the serial# for my Ipod. They told me it was out of warranty, that the warranty had expired in December of 2005 and there was NOTHING I could do, literally. I checked my purchase and found out that I had purchased this on April 7, 2005. I was so angry that they would tell me that it was out of warranty when it clearly was not. So, this is a warning to all Ipod owners of this potential problem\n",

       "My wife bought this as a gift for me, thinking that it included an FM tuner. For ten dollars more, she could have purchased a product that does everything this one does (it is essentially a $35 car charger) plus the tuner.  If you want to use this product to actually listen to your iPod in your car, you'll need to purchase yet another device: either the cassette adapter (old school! part F8V366-APL) or the FM transmitter (part F8V367-APL).  Either one connects through a jack in the side of this unit.  The FM transmitter is another $40 (you're now $20-30 over what the Monster iCarPlay, which does all of the above, would have cost you)...and, surprise!  The transmitter takes AAA batteries!  There's no way to power the transmitter through the Auto Kit.  To power the FM transmitter without batteries, you must purchase yet a third accessory, the \"Mobile Power Cord for iPod\" (F8V7067-APL, just $15!)...except your car's power plug is occupied by the Auto Kit, so you'll need to buy a twin-plug adapter for that.\n",

       "I am the owner of a home day care and I had all of the kids bring in T-shirts so that we could all create our own unique father's day gifts with these iron-on transfers. When I say that I followed the directions Precisely I am not fooling! I was so concerned about slip ups that I made sure I followed the directions to the letter, but every time I tried to pull off the cooled transfer paper off came half of the design and the rest styed on the paper! Very disappointing\n",

It is only (somewhat) in-focus for items about 1 inch away. Adjusting the focus ring doesn't help, so this camera's build seems to be defective. My brother bought the same camera and it doesn't seem to have the same problem. Anyway, returning mine.\n",

       "I had a D-link USB adaptor before which was really good, but was old.  I upgraded to a wireless G Linksys USB adaptor, but I was supplied with old goods (a Linksys sales manager confirmed that), so I sent that back.  I thought I'd try D-Link again.  Bad move.  First, I tried to upgrade the drivers.  My current version was 1.0.5.0.  I downloaded the version 1.12 from D-Link's site.  After uninstalling and reinstalling (several times) I still had 1.0.5.0.  An hour and a half on the phone with D-Link tech support and I still had 1.0.5.0.  Another hour on Google, and I'm not the only one with this issue.  Seems to be a version-control issue with D-Link.  Then, even more irritating, every time after I use my wired connection and go back to wireless I have to reinstall the drivers and reboot.  And re-enter all my security info again.  (I believe this has something to do with using a different USB port from the last time, but whatever the reason, it's unacceptable).  This adaptor's going back too.  Don't know what I'll try next. \n",

       "SUCKS I had this right form the start with my compaq 7970 which is amd k7 processor and has the via chipset.  The computer seemed to work for a while or at least had few errors when I first used it but I guess that was when I had windows 98 for 2 years. When I upgraded to windows XP it just got terrible I had frequent blue screens and errors. I thought it was my video card or my ram or Irq sharing tried all that didn't seem to be it.  Eventually I was wrong it was this card as mentioned before by others apparently it does not like some amount of internet use and when the card gets stuck it shuts down and windows xp just says error or points to the video card or irq sharing ot page fault in non page area as the problem.  The card was the problem buy another card other than fa310,fa311 the one I have and fa312 even if you have intel or something else I would not waist my money on this card it will probably give you problems down the road.  I have tried updates from [...] and updating my ram and video card  have checked my irqs and reformating hard drive none worked. I put in a 3 com card I bought a few years before this computer and wow no crashes that other computer is now wirelessly connected to my home network\n",

       "I have a G4 tower Mac that did have a built in Ethernet.  Unfortunately, a lightening strike took out the port and I was forced to get a PCI card to replace the port.  The first card I bought was the D-Link DFE-530TX+.  I was excited because the box clearly said that the card would work with Macs and that the \"minimum requirement\" was OS 10.2.\n",
       "\n",
       "They lied.  OS 10.2 is the _maximum_ for this card.  For most people, it won't work with 10.3 and up.  D-Link has no driver for 10.3 or higher, only 10.2.  A google search shows that some people have been able to get the card to work with 10.3.  I couldn't.  I tried several different drivers (some users recommended a driver from Realtek) and none worked.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's my guess (and totally a guess) that this card is really only for older Macs that are limited to 10.2.  D-Link doesn't seem to have any intention of supporting modern Macs.\n",

       "These radios look nice but there are some problems here. First the batteries do not last long unless you do not talk. Second the biggest problem for me was uncompatibility with other radios and brands. The receive quality is very poor and hard to understand at times. I also hace a T7200 and the difference is like night and day. The 7200 is the best. The 7400 i believe is an has flaws and that is why you see them priced so low. I paid $24.00 on ebay and also have seen the set at home depot clearance for $44.00 today. What good is any radio if you cant understand what someone is saying? Good try motorola but this is a poor product.NOT RECOMMENDED TO PURCHASE\n",

Maybe this thing works ok to \"charge\" while the iPod is not playing, but it is not an acceptable way to \"power\" the iPod while it is playing. \n",

       "I commute via public transportation, the majority of that on a noisy train. Earbuds and over ear headphones don't block out enough of the noise to enjoy the music. I received these Philips HN110 headphones as a gift. \n",
       "\n",
       "When I first got these I was pretty disappointed at how flimsy they appeared. I have some KOSS over ear head phones which are nice and beefy. These are scrawny but on the other hand take up less space. They use a single AAA batt. Using them on the train I was able to turn down the volume on my music player a tad but a lot of the noise still gets through. I'm not an expert on these but I guess this noise cancelling works mainly on lower frequencies. Alot of the noise on the train is higher in pitch and thus gets through. The next thing I noticed was that with a cord coming out of both the left and right earphone you are limited in how you can put these on and take them off. My KOSS and Sony headphones and earbuds use the single cord to one phone and the connecting cord from there (or it runs through the headphone band). I realize I like this single cord feature very much. Again these Philips HN 110 don't have this. \n",
       "\n",
       "I also noticed that when the Noise Cancelling is turned on and the wind is blowing you can hear the wind as if it were amplified. \n",
       "\n",
       "After about a month and a half the battery compartment door latch broke inside. Now I can't open the battery compartment without doing some damage to these headphones. I checked Philips website for info on these phones but I couldn't find any. I called their customer support and they told me I had to call a different #. I called the different number and got the Return Merchandise Authorization # but was told I need to send the receipt in. I got them as a gift so I don't have the receipt. \n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, their noise cancelling ability is pretty week. Better than my hefty non-noise cancelling KOSS over ears or my stethascope like Sony ear buds but only by about 10% or so (just to put a number in their). Flimsy design. Cords from both earphones. Hear the wind amplified. Battery compartment latch broke after a month and a half and their warrenty sucks\n",

I was about to scrap the cable altogether but I decided to resolder the connector to see if that would help. I cut off about half a foot of the cable and resoldered it, only to find that the same problem persisted. I got a bad cable, obviously..\n",

       "I bought the TDK Mojo 256 about a year and 3 months ago. It worked wonderfully for the first year - did what it was supposed to and the radio quality was great. Then I upgraded to Windows XP and that's when everything started going wrong. This MP3 player needs propreitary software to copy files from your hard disk or CD to the mp3 player. Unfortunately the software doesn't work well at all with XP. Right now, my player is piece of junk. I have tried copying files which it shows as copied but then when you reconnect the player, they don't show up on there. What's more, formatting the internal memory will also not release the space and so I have the internal memory full but it shows up in the software as free. However, it won't copy over any new files and gives me a \"Storage Full\" error. It doesn't act reliably with XP either and I had to unplug and replug several times for it to even read the list of songs on the mp3. It lasted all of 15 months. While it sounds like a great deal ( good features for price ). DO NOT buy this if you will be using it with XP and if you do, please don't expect it to last more than 12-15 months\n",

The display is poor and though they say \"up to 40 objects per hole\" there is normally 2-4 objects per hole. All this depends upon the Skycaddie course recorder. The user (you) can not modify the course or add any objects that the  course recorder didn't think was important.\n",
       "Now the bad part. The unit attaches via button and belt clip (like a cell phone). My button (part that attaches to main unit) has died twice in the first 30 days. When it breaks again,...which it will often,..the unit will probally hit the dirt. This isn't good. But fear not. It will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with Skygolf. And another week to get a replacement button (which has been modified even weaker than the original one). Now my replacement broke on the first time I clipped it to the belt. Now back to Skycaddie to get another. After being on hold for another hour, they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts. This will take another hour. You then get a message to leave a message. Normally within a week someone will call you back. By normally I mean about 35% of the time you leave messages they return them. Would I buy another,... duh,.... NO\n",

       "Have you ever heard the saying that something would cost you \"an arm and a leg\"? These cables cost that, your first son, and bidding rights to your estate. Don't get me wrong- Monster makes great cables. Let there be no confusion on this point. But they're just incredibly expensive, and this is made much worse with these cables.\n",
       "\n",
       "Several people have pointed out that the digital signal on HDMI cables must adhere to error-correction and certain standards (even a $10 cable cable must meet some specifications to even reach production)- and this is largely true. Unless BluRay implements new features that require new cables at some point in the future, there's really very little difference between HDMI cables. Yes, the gold-plated pins and other features will improve your connection a bit, but the improvement will be far less than you'd see between any other \"cheap\" versus \"designer\" cables on the market.\n",
       "\n",
       "But Monster cables really are made to a standard that makes some difference, and that's worth mentioning. This cable is built sturdy, so that none but the most harsh of treatment could ever damage it. And the shielding isn't just the usual electrical shielding- Monster cables are toughened to the point that I wouldn't doubt if they're certified against nuclear fallout. If you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an EMP strike, you're looking at the right cables.\n",
       "\n",
       "But for nearly all consumers, these cables cost 4x as much as alternatives, with no real plusses. At the very least, you can pick up a mid-grade cable (Sony, etc) at a mid-grade price ($40) to get the increased sturdiness and the gold-plated connections. And over these products, the Monster cables basically have nothing at all except their branding. Please do look up a cheaper alternative this time, and spend some of the extra money on an extra set of whatever tools you use to keep your screen clean. You'll get much better results with these tools than you will worrying about $100 HDMI cables\n",

       "I have to say, since I really started listening to music I have payed attention to a lot more detail of sound.  With that said I am not a bass junky; but bass and compression of the overall mix is what makes a sound a good sound.  I currently owned a pair of Sony MDR-EX81LP (that cost me 30-40 dollars a year ago) I am a medical student and I study all day and all night, but cannot have my music blasting.  Conversely I needed to have a nice isolation of my sound.  Comparing my old Sony to the new ER-6 that I just got, I am EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED with their performance.  I was expecting a great sound with minimal noise from the outside and get almost no response at the level that I studied with my old ear buds. To be fair remember that these are not noise cancelling, they are noise reducing.  There is no component involved here, they are basically really good earplugs with speakers in them.  My wife just ran the vacuum and I barely heard it.  The earplug reduced noise feature is great and comfortable; however my other ones (Sony earbuds) sound better.  A combination of the two would be great.  Keep in mind that this is my opinion and make your own based on why you are buying earbuds.  Environmental sound reduction is great, sound quality is not as good as some others.....choose your fault and pay attention to pricing. \n",

       "This machine is  great looking, compact, and  seems to be the perfect combination fax/answering machine/speakerphone.  One major problem:  The phone is well below average in sound quality,  and the speaker is absolutely terrible.  The tiny, poorly made speaker is placed in the back left side of the unit and and is totaly inaudible at loud volumes due to distortion.  The fax is great,  the print quality is great,  the speed is great, but you have to lower the volume and lean over with your head against the speaker  to hear messages.  This problem also renders the speakerphone useless.  I returned this unit twice thinking it was defective, but spoke to HP and was told that is just the way this unit works.  Buy the Panasonic KX-FHD351  if you  need a great sounding unit.  The only problem with the Panasonic is that it doesn't come in black,  but is a much better phone/answering/speakerphone. \n",

They didn't even send any notification email and i found my order cancelled by looking at the site. Amazon MUST learn that this is illegal and they must ship all the orders placed, if they made a mistake pricing the item is THEIR problem not ours and more after many customers confirmed the price over telephone. If Amazon don't ship the orders already placed they will throw stones over their own roof and make lots of bad publicity. I'm one of many who won't be buying anything ever if Amazon don't send me my ordered items. Count with me for any legal actions that may be taken\n",

Their site had SOFTWARE that was to help recover some of those lost images!!  I have never had Flash memory trouble until LEXAR!  I now only buy SCANDISK items. Samsung invented this tecnology and SD is their product. The Store I bought the LEXAR chip was in a hurry to give me another chip I could trust. He gave me the higher costing SD chip. I wasn't the first to have issues from buying it in his store. He took a $50.00 loss to make me happy. People take lots of photos now that we went Digital. Imagine looking for some pictures you know you took and they are not there!  Most think they messed up. WIth this chip you will have that happen so pay very close attention. Most of what is lost can not be recovered. Pay the extra money for SCANDISK.\n",

It occasionally generates a read error message (uh, yeah...).\n",

It took a long time to even get through their tech support lines the first night I had it, and then a lot of persuading to even get them to agree that their CD player was not working. Then they tried to convince to me send the brand new machine back, **for a price**, to have them repair it. Uh, no, not likely to fall for that--paying them to repair a brand new machine straight out of the box, taking time out of my way-too-busy life to ship it to them??  I finally have a reference number with permission to return it to the store for a full refund; so back it goes.\n",

       "I mainly chose this mouse because I needed one quickly and it was black and matched my set up. I had been using the standard greyish white optical mouse with a scroll wheel and a red light that shined out from under my wrist. This one feels smaller, but still comfortable. However a couple weeks of normal usage made the mouse much less solid feeling. The plastic now mushes as the seems flex slightly in my hand. I decided to have a friend repair the cable of my old mouse. :-/ I am going to donate this mouse to a friend who still has a tracking ball mouse. I like some of Logitechs products and higher end mice. But I would stay away from this mouse. Its not bad, its just not good enough to pick over other mice that cost the same amount.\n",

It works when the network is not encrpted. But it won't find an IP address under WPA security. It searches IP address endlessly. I have winxp sp2 which is supposed to support wireless flawlessly.

       "This may be one of the cheapest routers out there, but it's cheap in every way. I spent hours either on hold or talking with poorly trained overseas \"tech support\" whose expertise consisted of (barely) reading a script. Eventually these computer whizzes determined that my D-Link router didn't work. They told me to send it back (on my nickel, of course), and they sent me another one, which also did not work, at least not with my computer system. After more wasted hours, I was referred to the one guy at D-Link who--supposedly--has mastered this router's bugs. The problem? He never answered the phone. And despite all my calls to him and all my voicemails asking him either to call me at work or to set a time for us to talk, he repeatedly returned my calls at 3:00 in the afternoon, the time when most people who can afford routers are working. Finally I had an epiphany: Life was too short to %*@ with D-Link. I packed up the router and sent it back to the CEO, Stephen Joe, with a letter. Then I went out and bought a Netgear router, and I was up and running in minutes. Mr. Joe never responded to my letter, but what else do you expect from a company that so clearly doesn't value its customers\n",

       "Have had this router for over a year.  During this time the router constantly lost the internet connection, even when it's wired directly to my desktop PC.  The disconnect can last anywhere from a couple of seconds to minutes.  A new firmware (1.23) was released a few days ago for revision A (the version of the router I have).  D-Link's website said the firmware \"improved reliability\" so I decided to upgrade.  After flashing to the new firmware, the router will not let me into the control panel  or respond to pings.  The lights blink, that's all.  I've reset the router, but this does nothing to restore the old firmware.  D-link's firmware upgrade appears to have put this router out of its misery--which is perhaps for the best as it now forces me to finally go back to a reliable router company\n",

       "This review is more about my several month's experience with XM satellite radio and the not-so-good quality using the wireless FM frequencies through our car's radios. I live in Los Angeles.\n",
       "\n",
       "I got this little Roady XT for me, and the XM2GO radio receiver for my wife. I was excited about getting these new satellite receivers in our cars. The Idea of having all these \"no ads\" radio stations playing through my car's FM frequency seemed cool. \n",
       "    Setting up the unit and getting it to work was easy. Changing FM frequencies for the wireless transmitter is easy as well. It really is a neat little receiver. \n",
       "\n",
       "However, after setting up this unit in my car and the XM2GO in my wife's car, I was really disappointed in the music sound quality. The music sounds flat and with a hissy quality, almost monaural at times, and the volume seems a lot lower than the car's radio at the same volume setting. I had to turn the volume dial up quite a bit when playing satellite radio. The car's regular radio sounds much better than satellite radio if using wireless reception with any of the radio receivers, IMO. Besides, there are plenty of annoying ads and interruptions on XM radio as someone mentioned in another review.\n",
       "    \n",
       "I thought about having the units professionally installed so that my wife and I wouldn't have to use the poor sounding wireless FM technology, but realized that both family cars have very expensive navigation systems and I didn't want the vehicle's factory warranty voided if some installer got inside our car's dash and accidentally messed something up.\n",
       "\n",
       "So about two month's ago, after several months of off-and-on use of XM radio service, I called to cancel my subscriptions. I had paid for a six month subscription for both receivers when I joined. As I expected would happen, when I called them to cancel, I was on the phone for allloooooonnnng time waiting for a customer service rep. Finally, I got to tell the rep all my relevant account information so I could cancel the service only to be put on hold and transferred to their \"special\" customer service department for cancellations where I was \"accidentally\" disconnected and had to call back and start all over again.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, after another long call to them, I was able to cancel my service.....or, so I thought. Yesterday, I was looking at my September credit card bill and saw that XM radio had charged my credit card for the next six months despite the fact that they assured me that my two accounts would be closed. \n",
       "\n",
       "I called my bank and had them reverse the charges and I may have the bank issue me a new credit card with different numbers in case XM tries to charge me again six months from now.\n",

       "I got these batteries just over a few months ago for my portable GPS unit that I use often on my travels. In fact, I bought eight of them (two packs of 4). I was upgrading from my previous set of 1600mAh Rayovac NiMH AA batteries that were still going strong after 2 years. When I saw the new energizer 2500mAh rechargeables I was excited to purchase them thinking they would last longer than my old 1600mAh Rayovacs.  Boy was I wrong!\n",
       "\n",
       "For 2-3 months, the 2500mAh energizers worked well. A charge lasted about 6-7 hours in my portable GPS unit. I was getting roughly 5.5-6 hours on my old 1600mAh Rayovac AA's. My GPS unit is spec'ed for 6 hours on a pair of AA's so the new 2500mAh energizers seemed to work flawlessly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now they work okay and seem to be getting worse each time I charge them, appearing to hold less of a charge each time.  For the last month or two (4th &amp; 5th month after their initial purchase) I'll be lucky if I can get 4-5 hours of use out of them in my portable GPS unit. I now get roughly 3.5-4 hours of use out of them.  I pulled out and tried my old 1600mAh Rayovac AA's and once again got approximately 5.5-6 hours of use out of them in my GPS unit - and my trusty Rayovacs are just over 2 years old!\n",
       "\n",
       "I thought I might have had some defective energizers but I can't seem to get any pair of combinations to hold a decent charge. Charges just don't seem to last - it's really disappointing.  I am going to look at another brand for high capacity 2500+ mAh NiMH batteries to replace my 1600mAh Rayovacs. Would be great if the energizer could hold its charge. But because they don't, I do not recommend the energizers to anyone\n",

Using either one the card disconnects at random using WPA, then you have to repair the connection and sometimes reboot to get the connection back.  I reinstalled windows both times I changed drivers just to make sure nothing was conflicting with it, but nothing helped.  Latest drivers are 2_0_0_7 and were published in Nov 2004, so netgear has moved on to other cards and is not supporting this one any longer\n",

       "I bought the Zboard and was sorely disappointed in it's playbility, efficiency and value for several reasons:\n",
       "\n",
       "-The left buttons, which are the feature of the keyboard, are based on a mirroring system.  You experience keyboard lag at times because the board has to interpret the button presses based on the zboard program, then the game.  I personally had to press some buttons twice, or even three times in order for that command to register.\n",
       "\n",
       "-The left buttons cannot be configured to your game, you must configure the game to it.  The templates for different games cannot be modified, all it does is change the button configuration.  There are no patches for configuring the keys to how you want it.\n",
       "\n",
       "-According to the website, the top buttons for media can only be used with windows media player.  If you use winamp, itunes, or anything else it wont work.  \n",
       "\n",
       "-You cannot program any macros into any of the buttons.  If you are looking for a keyboard that can autofire or program keystrokes this isn't it.  \n",
       "\n",
       "- The numpad is configured differently than a normal keyboard.  This can actually be a good thing if you like having a compacted pad.  I found it frustrating since I put attack commands on the numbers, and would press the wrong one sometimes because of the layout.\n",
       "\n",
       "I experienced a lot of frustration with this controller while pvping in world of warcraft.  The top buttons on the left side of the board give you access to a bigger arsenal of spells and abilities when programmed right.  The problem is remembering how zboard configured the button layout.  I would constantly get wailed on because a button wasn't where I originally remembered it to be.  This forced me to sit in the key bindings menu to configure the buttons to where I could remember.  After completely revamping my bindings, I gave up, restored my defaults, and used a regular keyboard instead.\n",
       "\n",
       "There is nothing gaming enhancing about this keyboard beyond having an accessory on the left side that looks cool because the buttons are grey and red and contoured to your hand.  \n",
       "\n",
       "To achieve the same effect as the zboard, turn your current keyboard slightly to the right and enjoy.\n",

The spacing of the velcro dots means I never get exactly the right fit and the band gets ripped off anytime I do weight lifting close to my body.    It is also as other reviewers mentioned hugely overpriced for what it is.  I am ordering a band from a different company and this will go straight to the garbage.\n",

       "I logged 870 miles with the iway 350.  270 miles around maryland it was / is a great item. I took it on our first trip to New York and Long Island and it was terrible. The first problem occurred on the New Jersey turnpike. I was supposed to use the turnpike from start to exit 18 and at exit 4 we stopped to eat. The unit said I was off course because the rest area was 100 feet from the highway. However when we returned to the highway the unit could not chart the course any more. It said I was doing 95 miles a hour when i was doing 70, and it would lose satellites and go searching for them in the middle of the highway no obstructions of any kind anywhere. I even pulled over at exit 6 and we waited for 20 minutes to see if we just needed to stop the car for it to do the job. It did not recalculate our course until after exit 18 some 100 + miles from when it acted up. We even tried a full restart and cancel route and retried again from the address book and from direct typing the information again. About 1 mile from our destination it worked for 2 blocks and was lost again. Then after 2 more blocks we found where we where going. We often get lost on this trip this is why we purchased the unit. Then on the trip from the Bronx to Long Island a 30 mile trip it stopped 5 blocks into the journey and was recalculating. I had to call the people we where visiting and they directed us by phone. However about 1 mile from their place it started working again. We used it on long island with no trouble at all. Then on  trip back to the Bronx it worked pretty good only losing its position once on a major highway no trees or obstructions. Then on our way back from the Bronx to long Island it was lost half the way finding position and calculating . The same exact way we went in both directions but it was clearly not right leaving the Bronx. On our way back to Maryland it operated pretty good after a short stretch of lost signals and redirecting and we used exactly the same roads in both directions. I did update the software to the new 1.2.0 days before we took the trip.  \n",
       "\n",
       "Also charting the 212 mile course to the Bronx NY took close to 20 minutes, then the extra destination to Long Island a 30 mile addition took the Iway 350 30 or so more minutes. I figured with all that time the trip home calculations would be faster but I fell asleep after waiting  over a hour for it to complete the task. I feel this is one issue the unit has. Longer trips take so long to calculate so when it thinks your off track it takes forever to chart a new course. On short runs under 20 miles it was very fast.\n",
       "\n",
       "I returned the unit and got a Garmin C530. The C530 is a very nice unit fast in every respect.\n",

       "The 350C is well packaged with almost current programming. It only got me lost eleven (11) times on a 865 mile trip:All cities in Georgia - Tybee Island to Pine Mountain to Newnan to Stone Mountain and return to Tybee Island. (I packed and returned the unit the day after getting home.) It may suit others well, but I can not rely on the unit. Four of the eleven lost episodes were because newly constructed highways were not recognized. Five were due to the unit reacting too slowly in rapid turning sequences. (One wrong turn took me sixty miles out of the way.)Two were for unknown reasons. The unit seems to take forever to acquire available satellites. Instructions are clear, but preferred views automatically switch to \"Map\" even when not wanted. I need a faster reacting unit that allows programming while enroute to a destination (by a passanger, of course.\n",

       "I bought this unit on a wim.  I was leaving for a business trip and needed a GPS.  I really like it and it worked well for me.  Unfortunalty the unit wouldn't hold a charge on the battery.  So I returned it for another one.  It worked for one week and then I had the same exact problem.  Which to me is not a good sign of quality when the same problem happens on multiple units.  When I tried to return this unit, the unit I was given didn't work at all, it gave me an error message when the GPS booted up.  Unfortunaltey the vendor I purchased it from didn't have any more units that I could exchange it for.  So I called customer service and got an RAN.  I am hoping when I get the next unit back in 7 to 10 days that I don't have any more problems\n",

       "The DVD burner connected very easily through USB, was immediately recognized by WinXP, the software installation was fine. I was beginning to feel good. However, whenever I burned a DVD (I tried 4 different brands, some R, some RW etc...), several files would contain errors, and would be completely unreadable. The burning process moreover does not detect this: one needs to verify the data written to check and find these errors. Moreover, the firmware update just does not work on my machine, pardon, machineS. Completely standard Dell machines, all latest WinXP and drivers, good CPUs (3Ghz and up), lots of memory, big hard-drives. I called customer service to try to solve the problem. First of all the average waiting time to get to a technician was about 30 minutes. The rudeness and the plain lies these guys give you are amazing. To make a long story short, I had to call 3 times. First guy: oh, \"of course it doesn't work, you have EasyCD creator installed!\". Ok, I buy it, I go through the (painful) uninstallation process of Roxio's software. No problems solved. Second guy: \"Oh, of course it does not work, it requires 10Gb of free hard-drive space! It's written on the box\". Plain lie: on the box it says you need 10Gb for NeroVision (for burning videos), but only 1Gb for Nero. Quarrel (they are tough!) with the guy who could not care less about the fact I got him lying, or that the product description is wrong. Ok, patiently I freed up 10Gb from hard drive, try again, exactly same problem. The only thing they could offer in the end was a replacement. I got perhaps relative lucky because the replacement will be a 720, not a 710, since 710 is not manufactured anymore (wonder why?). Notice I tried this on two different machines (one laptop and one desktop), with identical results.\n",
       "Other lie: I noticed, as somebody else here, that the Nero software provided writes only on Sony drives: so if Nero is really the only software that should be installed because of conflicts with Roxio (et al.?), you will never be able to use your own CD drive to burn CDs. How ridicolous is that???? The technician said this is because I had both software(s) installed, but that was another lie.\n",
       "The incompetence of these guys is beyond belief. If the new drive will not work, I hopefully will get a refund through my credit card. You know, the technician even said that that is not possible, credit cards companies do not do that (LOL)\n",

       "I had this adapter running in my the Cardbus slot of my Windows 98 computer and it ran fine. I installed it on my Windows 2000 laptop. Well, my first sign of trouble was a warning popup when I installed the drivers that the drivers were not certified by Microsoft. So, imagine my shock when my brand new computer constantly got Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) crashes. Big blue screen, loss of data, computer freezes tight, power button inoperative, and when you have to use a pin to press that tiny little laptop reset button on a brand new computer, well, we all know that's when you're in Computer Hell.\n",
       "\n",
       "I'm a Microsoft Certified Professional so I was able to narrow down the source of the problem. After definitely identifying the FA511 as the culprit, I contacted Netgear's online  tech support. And that's when things really started to get ugly.\n",
       "\n",
       "It took forever for Netgear to finally give me an answer. This was after days of inactivity, wildly inappropriate responses, and repeatedly requesting same information from me.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, Netgear escalated the problem to their next level of tech support and I was shocked to read their solution: \"This is a Windows issue regarding permissions and ***16 BIT*** compatibility mode\" While they were vague as to the exact nature of the problem, and contradicted themselves as to whether compatibility mode had to be enabled or disabled, their solution was straightforward: I was directed to a Microsoft Knowledge Base article which tells you how to enable Compatibility Mode - and for 16-bit compatibility mode I had to make my nice clean Windows 2000 computer compatible with Windows 95 (yes, ninety-five).\n",
       "\n",
       "So, while the FA511 hardware is a 32-bit Cardbus adapter, apparently their drivers are 16-bit!!! No wonder the FA511 was never certified for Windows 2000. And I wouldn't trust it for Windows XP either.\n",
       "\n",
       "There are other Ethernet adapters out there by 3COM, Belkin, Linksys, SMC, and Xircom that work flawlessly with Windows 2000/XP by companies that will respond to your questions. Go get them. Avoid the FA511\n",

It is a tremendous ripoff to buy an AC adapter seprately (and at $30), but then again, I'm sure Apple is making a ton off of this gimic, but I refuse to contribute. I can see not including a dock, A/V cables, etc, as those aren't   essential iPod accessories. But an AC adapter? Come on. Bad Apple. Bad!\n",

       "I have been a DVR user through Cox Cable for approx. 1 yr, and have always been disappointed.  I have kept my eye on Tivo for some time, and when my DVR box went out for the 2nd time, I decided it was time to try Tivo.  I got a refurbished Series2 DVR that was free for signing a 1 yr commitment for $12.95 per month. \n",
       "\n",
       "I received the Tivo only 2 days after I ordered, very impressive since I didn't pay to have it shipped that quickly.  The setup was reasonably straight forward.  I had heard so much about Tivo that I had very high expectations, and here are the problems I encountered that surprised me:\n",
       "\n",
       "1)  My first mistake was not recognizing that you have to get a Dual tuner unit to be able to record 2 seperate programs (DVR does this automatically).  So I ordered the wrong unit.  To be honest, I don't see how this service is very useful at all with only a single tuner, my family relies on dual tuners A LOT.  I am shocked that Tivo even offers a single tuner system, to me it's like a tricycle compared to a 10 speed, a dual tuner is so much more useful.  \n",
       "\n",
       "2)  I thought I would be able to hook up a wireless receiver to connect to my home network.  No, you have to buy theirs for $40 to $50.  Since I didn't know that, I had to rely on the phone line option.  This really stinks, it is very very very slow.  I spent 2 hrs trying to download one days programming, the system kept getting interuppted during download (yes I disabled call waiting).  \n",
       "\n",
       "3)  When you use the online program guide, it covers up the entire screen.  My Cox DVR puts the TV in upper right corner (approx. 1/4) asnd the rest of the screen lets you see the guide.  We use this all of the time to see if there is anything better on, but that won't work so well with Tivo.  Plus, scrolling up and down is painfully slow, the screen takes for ever to refresh.\n",
       "\n",
       "4)  Similarly to item 3 above, when you review recorded programs the show you are watching is turned off completely, you can only see the Tivo guide.  Again, Cox DVR lets me look at my list and delete files etc.. all while my TV program stays visible in the upper right corner.  \n",
       "\n",
       "5)  Remote wouldn't work with my 42\" Akai plasma.  I can't fault Tivo too much on this one, none of the universal remotes seem to work with this TV for some reason.  \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "I did love some of the Tivo features and wish my Cox DVR had them:\n",
       "1)  Wishlist\n",
       "2)  Tivo Suggestions\n",
       "3)  Can access your Tivo through internet\n",
       "4)  View photo's through Tivo.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the end my items # 3 and 4 were things I just couldn't get past, so I returned my Tivo.  They were friendly and helpful and I really wanted to like this product, but in my opinion it's not able to compete with the speed and power of the Cable companies DVR. \n",

All I saw were blocky artifacts that seemed to be blinking. I even had the DNR (digital noise reduction) enabled and it didn't help. Most recordings skipped and stuttered at the beginning. I took it back for refund and Best Buy told me this model is known for doing that. I don't see how Panasonic can put their name on this junk. Those cheap $99 recorders you find at Walmart have better quality than this. \n",

       "I've been using my BEFW11S4 for a few months now. The little thing has its good points - a nice, unobtrusive little box I can just plug in and hide on top of some piece of office furniture, allowing my rather over-laptop-equipped household some nice convenient net access, while still allowing the home office systems a wired connection.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sounds nice, if it only worked. Howver, BEFW11S4 has a MAJOR problem, and a rather common one at that. Specifically, it locks up. It does so frequently. I have to unplug the router at least once a day, and frequently twice, to deal with it locking up. Can't even access the administrator screen, and even hitting the reset button isn't enough to fix it. Wireless isn't too useful when you have to physically walk to the unit multiple times a day, is it?\n",
       "\n",
       "The problem seems to lie not in the hardware, but in the firmware (the software that runs on the router). If Linksys would release reliable firmware for this router, I'd give it 4-5 stars. But until they resolve the issue that wires down their wireless modem, I can't possibly justify giving the BEFW11S4 more then two stars\n",

       "The first Vista Cx I purchased died after only 3 days of use. I returned it to Amazon who immediately and painlessly replaced it.  The second unit lasted for 4 days until I fell waist deep into a stream with the unit in my pocket. Though it was only submersed for a matter of seconds it immediately stopped working and water was seen internally around the screen. Garmin's claim of waterproofness for 1m for 10 minutes is utter baloney. The poorly designed T-style lock on the battery case cannot possibly assure water integrity from anything beyond high humidity. I probably wouldn't buy buy another Garmin but I'm stuck with them as I have already invested $200 in proprietary MapSource software.  I guess that was their plan.\n",

       "The first subwoofer died (no sound) after 6 days.  Remember, the sub powers all the speakers in this system.  I sent it back to the company I bought it from and they were nice enough to take care of \"Klipsch's faulty product\".  They asked me if I would like a refund and like an idiot I said, \"No, just send me another one\".  The replacement Klipsch system arrived and it played great for about 14 months and then NOTHING.  No power from the sub!  Same problem but now my warranty is up.  Klipsh has a way of designing things to work just past the warranty.  Shame on Klipsch for making such a shoddy product.  Shame on me for asking for a replacement and getting burned twice.  Heed all these warnings my friends.  I would buy used speakers at a garage sale before I would buy another Klipsh product.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!    \n",

       "These speakers do sound great but just like many others who have reviewed these speakers, they eventually just stop working. It sounds like I was one of the lucky ones as mine lasted two years. But I really didn't use them all that much and I don't blast the volumes. When you spend this kind of many on a product it should at least last 5 years or so. I've never had any other speaker brand just stop working on me before. Worse of all is to hear that Klipsch is charging a lot of money to repair their faulty products  and that people had problems with them even after they were \"repaired\". Well, I'm not wasting time and money on repairing them. I'm just switching to Logitech. No more Klipsch ever again for me.\n",

It takes me about a hundred swipes on average to get the biometric sensor to work...That is keeping data a bit TOO secure to be helpful.  Also there have been reports of complete data loss by others,but I've not had that experience - could be I just haven't been able to GET to my data enough to find out.  Support from Lacie was completely unhelpful (wash your hands and the sensor before swiping which I have already done dozens of times was the only suggestion).  If the drive could be partioned so you could have a secure partition and an easier to access partion, the failure of biometrics would not be so serious, but as is, I would definitely not purchase this again, and I would strongly advise against it unless there is some kind of firmware or other improvement\n",

       "You'd think that a Palm screen protector from Palm would be best in class. However, these Palm \"premium\" screen protectors have a lifespan of about 3-4 days at best. I'm very careful with my new Palm TX, yet under normal use the stylus easily scratches the screen protector to such an extent that the device no longer accurately recognizes stylus input. I also dislike having to cut the screen protectors to size. I've tried an Invisible Shield screen protector, and it was tough as nails; the problem was that installation was difficult, and the tacky surface also produced input errors. Next I'm trying a Boxwave ClearTouch. I never had this sort of problem with the old Fellowes WriteRight protector, which lasted a year or more on my old Palm m130\n",

       "The Koss Pro4AAT headphones are quality headphones, but sounds weak when driven through a regular headphone jack from your receiver or tv.  To get the great sounds that everyone else seems to rave about, you really need to run these headphones through a headphone amp.  Also, the ear pads are of a vinyl-like material which doesn't breathe well, making it uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.  I've read that leatherette pads are available, but so far haven't been able to find them.  The warranty alone is great, but I wouldn't recommend these headphones unless you have a headphone amp\n",

Like other reviews you see here, people started not being able to hear me, but I could hear them. So the microphone broke. But, I called Uniden tech support and they recommended I replace the battery on the phone for $37. So, I just ordered a new phone and tested the headset -- sure enough it wasn't the phone -- it was the headset. A costly mistake. I would not buy this headset again. Also, Amazon has a 30 day return policy, so if it breaks, make sure you return it within that 30 days or you are stuck with it\n",

Surely, I'm not so technically savvy as my son, but I can read and write and follow directions. The setting up of the equipment is quite complicated, in my view, far moreso than it should be. I've set up other peripherals with success, but this product is more than I can handle. I've followed the directions, over and over, and still the router doesn't connect. I've given up. Can't handle the frustration. By the way, I'm way over the age of 13. I have grandchildren over the age of 13.\n",

       "I contacted D-Link support and they verified that this product was tested and worked with a very minimum number of popular USB printers (I believe the number was around 30-40).\n",
       "The D-Link DP-G321 Wireless Print server did not work with any of the 3 USB printers I owned (Lexmark Z320, HP PSC 1250, HP Photosmart 7310). It worked okay with my one parallel HP Laserjet 1100 and I was able to connect it to my network and install the print server, but it was not at all compatible with my printers which was key. It this product was more compatible, I would have rated it 4 stars, because the installation was very easy and almost worry-free, plus it was very sensitive to the wireless radio waves i.e. it sensed my secured wireless network when other print server could not in that same location.\n",
       "I returned the D-Link and bought instead a Linksys WPS54GU2 print server that worked with all of my printers, but it was not as sensitive as the D-Link DP-G321, so I had to move my printers and print server closer to my wireless access point\n",

       "Several reviews mention the improvement when these cables to replace  a composite (L/R audio + video) cable, or an S-video (multi-pinned plug). ALmost all of that improvement is due to the fact that these cable connection methods are completely different types in signal format and the TV uses different internal circuitry for each one. Virtually any S-video cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable, and any component (individual R-G-B video) connection will be better than S-video. Cable brand has absolutely nothing to do with it. There may be some difference between one brand of component cable and another, but its almost always unnoticable\n",

       "I was in the market to upgrade my printer and used Amazon's reviews to decide on a Canon MP530. It does a good job, but when I plug the USB cord into the printer, the connection to the Internet drops every time. I have to disconnect from the printer so I can get on-line. Recently I filled out a rather lengthy application on the Internet and plugged in the USB cable so I could print. That step caused the connection to drop and I got to reenter all the information. I will be returning the Canon MP530 and start my search for another all-in one printer\n",

I took it to best buy where I bought it and they told me that it has \"external damage\" and didn' repair it. I send it to Apple service and return it without services because the same reason. My Ipod didn't have that damage, it has only a few scratches on the screen. After lots of calls and fight they told me that to fix it I would have to pay US$250.00 that is almost what it cost new.

The second is that although the incoming volume is fine, the people on the other end have trouble hearing me and say that i sound 'far away and very soft'. Troubleshooting and reseting doesn't seem to help. Will return ASAP\n",

       "It looks sexy, but it just doesn't work. The scroll pad is so finicky I wanted to throw it out the window after the first hour. About half the time it moves the cursor when you want to scroll, or it scrolls when you want to move the cursor. The other half the time, it does nothing no matter what part of the pad you touch or how hard or lightly you press. Also beware that if you return this just because you're not satisfied with how it works, Amazon will charge you for both outgoing and return postage!

       "After seeing a wide range in the prices for HDMI cables, I did some research into why is it. Found out that these cables carry digital signals (0's and 1's), so no matter what kind of fancy name you add before this cable, its basic purpose is simple like a cat5 cable. Then I went ahead and bought the cheaper ones which are working perfectly fine. So, dont be fooled by the high price cables. There is no special sheilding &amp;%*p in them. Its all misleading marketing. For this length of cable, I would pay maybe $5\n",

       "I really enjoyed my Zen, when it worked.  The first one I ordered I had to return becuase it would only play every other song, and after it started acting up all the lights would start blinking and I would have to take out the battery to make it stop.  So, I exchanged it for a new one, and just like the other after only one week the lights started going crazy again, it would freeze up, and would only play 5 seconds of every song. What I liked about it, for the small amount of time I had it was the sound quality, the choice in colors, and the fact that it was so much cheaper than other models with the same amount of storage space.  I'm not sure I would recommend it becuase of the fact that they both only worked for a few days.  Now I have an Iriver Clix and have had no problems.  It has less storage but I don't care, it is easier to control and I haven't had problems with it\n",

       "The Memorex DVD+R has got to be one of the worst dvd-r's out in the market. Not only is the rate of a successful DVD burn very low (movies, games, etc.), it also has a horrible shelf life that lasts for about four months. From what I hear from other members, Memorex uses a low-quality dye, and is explicitly evident in the red colored deterioration of the dye that can be seen on the top layer of the disk. All my DVD+R's are actually stained RED for some reason?!? Overall, go with verbatim or heck, even COMPUSA dvd's will be more suffice than this garbage\n",

I now have to hold it in place with rubber bands. Now, the player will constantly shut off whenever it moves the slightest bit. The radio, however(before it broke)was great, the organization of the files was good and the mic worked okay if you talked straight into it.

Every time the typewriter is turned on, we find that it either types the wrong letter (press a Q, it prints an S; press E and get P, etc.) or else it prints the correct letter but they are not spaced correctly (some overlapping, some huge spaces). There is some esoteric combination of keystrokes that, supposedly, will reset the programming. But this is just too much for Mom. Also, every time it's turned on, you have to re-program the line spacing, the tabs and everything else. I ended up buying a 40-year-old manual typewriter on e-Bay and Mom is much happier with it\n",

The first one I ordered I had to return becuase it would only play every other song, and after it started acting up all the lights would start blinking and I would have to take out the battery to make it stop.  So, I exchanged it for a new one, and just like the other after only one week the lights started going crazy again, it would freeze up, and would only play 5 seconds of every song. What I liked about it, for the small amount of time I had it was the sound quality, the choice in colors, and the fact that it was so much cheaper than other models with the same amount of storage space.  I'm not sure I would recommend it becuase of the fact that they both only worked for a few days.  Now I have an Iriver Clix and have had no problems.  It has less storage but I don't care, it is easier to control and I haven't had problems with it\n",

       "I bought this item about two months ago and was happy as can be. No more equipment in the tv room! About two weeks ago though, I noticed that the unit was slower and slower and I had to hit buttons repeatedly to get things done. It has eventually gotten to the point that it does not work at all. At first I thought it was batteries in the remote, so I replaced those a few times. Then I thought the placement of the IR transmitter was off, so I moved it closer to my AV rack. That worked at first, but the problem persisted so I reprogrammed, but to no avail. Eventually I narrowed it down to the remote unit. Even with the remote RIGHT NEXT TO THE IR Transmitter, it now does not work most of the time. Of course the real problem now is that all my av stuff is in a different room, so standard IR remotes (why do they even make those still????) are out of the question. I will be moving onto something else and keep my fingers crossed. \n",
       "Along the way I learned a few other things...other reviewers are right in that the memory gets eaten up quickly when you have to program the unit (which I do with a new LG DVD player). In theory, this is a great unit and the remote is very good when it comes to commands. In practice, however, all it did was make me hungry for an RF system that will work more consistently. \n",

Inside they have dissimilar circuit boards.  The real difference is the two new radios are unable to tune stations nearly as well as the older radios.  I would recommend not purchasing this radio\n",

       "I purchased this product and ran home to try it out.  not 5 minutes after plugging it in to my computer, my computer freezes.  I restart and it says my device is malfunctioning.  I manage to get it working for about 5 minutes before it craps out on me again.  I try upgrading the drivers and it refuses to connect to my network. I'm a network engineer and I am well versed in what I am doing, but this card has given me nothing but trouble. I had to disable the software that came with it and use the windows wireless software to connect.  This only keeps me alive for about 30 minutes before freezing.  I talked to netgear support and they tell me that my processor isn't supported, which is total BS and just an attempt to get out of supporting me, they wouldn't even let me return the product.  My advice: go with linksys or d-link or SMC, ANYONE but netgear\n",

       "Several reviews mention the improvement when these cables to replace  a composite (L/R audio + video) cable, or an S-video (multi-pinned plug). ALmost all of that improvement is due to the fact that these cable connection methods are completely different types in signal format and the TV uses different internal circuitry for each one. Virtually any S-video cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable, and any component (individual R-G-B video) connection will be better than S-video. Cable brand has absolutely nothing to do with it. There may be some difference between one brand of component cable and another, but its almost always unnoticable\n",

       "I purchased the case along with my new Palm TX to protect it on trips or whenever carrying it. It's a metal shell with a molded plastic liner. The little plastic catch in the lid half, which keeps the case closed, never seemed to work quite correctly, requiring several sliding motions before it would click shut. On a trip on March 3rd, this very small lip of plastic molded into the case broke away. Now it has no catch to keep it closed. Since the case cost me about $24 new and I'd only get about half price for the return, I figure the broken little catch costs me too much to return. I'll use a rubber band around the case, reminding me how flimsy and insufficient the case closing mechanism is. Save your money and don't buy this case. I don't remember reading the reviews before I ordered it -- so there's a $24 lesson\n",

Using plastic in rubber hinges was a bad idea which simply does not work well.  See my other reviews for better iPod protectors\n",

       "First off, I bought this headset for gaming, which anyone who enjoys the pastime will tell you how quickly the hours can melt away. Gamers are dependant on an ultra comfortable pair of headphones that we shouldn't be able to feel. I have been searching high and low for the Holy Grail of comfort and I was certain paying $90+ for a \"gaming\" headset would be the end of my search. Sorry, these guys are going back.\n",
       "\n",
       "I've tried a couple \"cheap\" Best-Buy headsets that I found painful to wear after an hour or so. Then I decided to spring for \"top of the line\". I wore these for 15 minutes before it became obvious this headset was not the Holy Grail I've been looking for.\n",
       "\n",
       "The headset itself feels flimsy and cheap. The padding is made of an itchy fabric, and even on my small head, it feels tight. The earphones do not cover my ears and I can feel them slowly being crushed. I'm not impressed with the sound, but I could overlook that if they were comfortable to wear. I didn't even bother to try the mic.\n",
       "\n",
       "If this is how Sennheiser makes their high end gaming equipment, I think it's safe to say I will avoid these guys in the future. The $30 pair of Aiwa's I wear at work are more comfortable than this and sound the same... if only that pair had a mic.\n",
       "\n",
       "*My ears still feel uncomfortable after taking the set off and then writing this review- I couldn't imagine wearing them for a few hours while gaming. If I find the perfect pair I'll let you all know\n",

       "I've been a fan of Sony earbuds for many years.  Due to the bad reviews of durability of the latest Sony earbuds, I decided on purchasing these Panasonic headphones. I bought these headphones because my Sony headphones died after 3 years and to upgrade my factory Creative Zen Micro headphones.  I found a perfect fit between the 3 size earplugs.  I've noticed that it does block out the sound in your surroundings.  It's good for that commute to work when there is a lot of noise.  I like the around the neck feature.  As far as quality, the extention part of the wiring looks durable but not the around the neck part of it.  As far as the performance of the headphones, I'm really disappointed in these headphones.  My factory Creative headphones had out performed these.  The bass level is too low even when I max out the bass in the player.  The mids and treble sound like crap. Don't waste your money on these!  Now I have to spend more money to replace these poor quality headphones!  argh!\n",

I was planning on using this for work, as I get a lot of DVD's from clients - so I popped one of those in and guess what?  It came up as \"invalid disc\".  It's supposed to play the majority of formats, and I triple checked the disc in my other dvd players, and it worked in my Panasonic DVD/VHS combo player.  A store-bought DVD worked fine (although I didn't play it much more than the first menu) so I know it's not broken.\n",

       "I ordered 2 of these, realizing they would have limited adjustment range - other reviews are correct in that they are very limited in their travel. What prompts my one star rating and subsequent return of my order is that they will not hold their rated weight. This model is supposed to hold a 25 lb. monitor; it failed miserably at attempting to hold my 23 lb. iMac. There is no tension adjustment (already as tight as it would go) and the computer just flopped forward. With a light monitor, I'm sure it would be fine, but don't expect even close to the stated 25 lb. rating. \n",

       "I spent $400 16 months ago on two very similar portable Audiovox DVD players for my kids, for long roadtrips.  They were handled with care, never abused or exposed to severe temperatures.  I think we got about 6 trips out of them, then the screens went blank while in use and both units died within 24 hours of each other.  Circuit City informed me the product is no longer on their shelves and referred me to Audiovox, who will do nothing since the product is now out of warranty.  Extended warranties are useless on this kind of product -- who can wait 6-8 weeks for repairs?  Parents, find another brand\n",

I don't think this happened because of any handling issues seeing as how the base just sits on my desk.  I don't think it has ever left my office and I don't tend to put items on top of the wire that might crush it.

       " First, even though it records wav files, it does not let you handle them well at all. To transfer recordings to your computer, you have to install special software (included), but you cannot transfer wav files back to the recorder (according to the software guide). If you want a recorder/player to function easily like that, you should go for the more expensive ones that allow you to use them as a USB flash drive (like the Creative Zen series). I did not install the software, as it offered nothing other than the simple transfer of a recording to my computer. I can record directly to the PC with much higher quality, so why bother? Noise recorded in a high quality format is still noise. It makes more sense to simply repeat anything I record on the Olympus and record it directly to the PC.\n",
       "\n",
       "Second, the sound quality is not great. Given that wav files are what are used on CDs, one would expect more than what this device delivers. It is noisy on either of the mic settings, and I would have to describe the sound quality as medium. Don't expect high fidelity. This is a voice recorder for recording quick notes and not much else. Even analog tape would be better for most things. I may be fussier than most about this, having some professional background in audio, so the sound quality may be okay for most people. People have gotten used to lower standards in just about everything.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, playback was very disappointing to me. It has only the simplest playback features. It plays, pauses, fast forwards, and reverses, period. You cannot repeat either a single recording or portion of one, and you cannot create any kind of list to specify only certain files to play. It plays (manually) one recording at a time and that is it. You cannot set markers to fast forward or reverse to (like chapters on a DVD), and searching through a recording of any length is a major pain. In fact, this recorder is defined more by what it cannot do than what it can do. It is well built physically, although it is definitely designed for small hands, and can be a bit uncomfortable to use if your hands aren't small.\n",
       "\n",
       "If all you want is to record medium quality voice, this will work fine. Don't expect it to record music or anything like that - you will be disappointed. Think of it as the audio version of a $20 digital camera. Cheap, quick, grabs the image, but no frills at all. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. \n",
       "\n",
       "I am usually very happy with Olympus gear, but this is definitely below their usual standard. Unless your needs are very spartan and smple, I would recommend looking at more capable devices\n",

       "\n",
       "2.  Buttons are labeled, organized, and layed out confusingly.  For example, why not have an \"alarm interface\" which would include all of the alarm modes and features, and maybe a \"radio interface\" which would include all of the radio functions/settings.  You would really understand how confusing this is if you were to actually go through the process of operating this alarm clock.  But really, don't do it, make the smart choice.\n",

       "3.  Too many features/modes.  I understand some people prefer all of the different features, but I wanted a simple alarm clock with a buzzer/radio, and clock.  Of course all of these special modes are set as the default, so it is a pain to try and configure all of the settings to a simple mode.  So for those who want a simple alarm clock, definitely DO NOT GET THIS!!\n",

       "4.  The button handling event is flawed.  For example, sometimes when I push a button, it does not handle the event (the device doesn't think that you pressed the button).  So I would have to press the button again and check to see if the radio handled the button input correctly.\n",

       "I ordered the Passport X50 from Amazon to save the $18 shipping Escort Radar was charging. I was told by someone at Escort Radar that Amazon was an authorized reseller.\n",
       "\n",
       "After having my detector on for ten minutes (right out of the box), it did three \"SELF CAL\"s, then said \"SERVICE REQUIRED\". I called Escort Radar and was told \"If you let the car power up the unit when you start the car, the voltage can be all over the place and the unit gets confused. You must first start the car, and then use the thumbwheel to turn on the detector.\" It makes some sense, but if this is really the case, why don't they put those instructions in their manual? After trying this many times, the unit was \"still confused\", so I returned it for a replacement.\n",
       "\n",
       "My second detector worked for maybe thirty minutes before the same thing happened. This time Escort Radar told me \"if you leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter over night, this has been found to cause problems.\" Well my lighter power goes off when I turn off the ignition, so this doesn't apply. Escort Radar also told me that \"excessive heat\" has been causing them problems. Now we have had a few days of 100� heat, and I'm sure the car gets hotter parked in the sun, but the design engineers should have accounted for these conditions plus some margin when you design something that is supposed to work in a car. It gets a lot hotter in other parts of the country. There are no warnings in the manual about not using it above 90� or leaving it off in a hot car. You wouldn't design a ski that doesn't work below 35�, would you???\n",
       "\n",
       "The most troubling part of my conversation with Escort Radar service department was they told me Amazon is not an authorized reseller, and they have no idea where they are getting the units from. Furthermore, they will not honor any warranty nor will they ever repair the unit, not even for money.\n",

       "I bought the iriver mobile transmitter hoping that i would be able to listen to my mp3 player through my radio. I like the fact that it is easy to use and that you can choose your station, but i live in monroe and we get stations from toledo and detroit, which is a problem because most or all of the stations are occupied or have interference and the transmitter is not strong enough to block out the slight interference from far away stations. I didnt think to check to see how many stations i could use for this product, looking back, i should have. i would only recommend this transmitter if you live somewhere that there aren't many stations that you can listen to on the radi\n",

       "The Bel RX65 worked great, for about 1 month.  After that, it started flashing \"SelfCal\" and \"Service Requiered\" on the screen.  Sent it in to Bel for them to fix the problem.  After about 10 days I got the product back, only to have it repeat exactly the same problems again within 2 days of having it.  I feel like I've been ripped off, because they either didn't even look at it or they don't know how to test something for a problem.  I spent $300 for a detector that doesn't work as well as a $40 one (and I know, I've had both)!\n",

       "Samsung is the WORST.  We bought this TV in August and it was delivered in September to our new house.  We opened it on a Sunday, plugged it in and watched it for a while, then on Monday it would not come on.  They thought it was a lamp, but that didn't fix it so they came and got it to service it.  We bought it for football season and football season is half over and we still have no TV.  They decided to replace it since they couldn't fix it.  That was three weeks ago.  Now they are giving us the runaround blaming shipping/warehouse/etc for the delay in sending the new one.  During a phone conversation with Samsung they basically said they were so far behind on shipping because they had so many to ship out (ie lots of them have problems and are being replaced is the way I took it.\n",

       "After waiting almost 6 months for this Skypephone, and its competitor from Belkin, to come to market through numerous postponements, I just gave up and bought an Asus P525 smartphone. For just over double the price of the Netgear I got a Windows CE PDA with GSM capability and full Skype compatibility. When browsing through your phone contacts your are given the choice to call through GSM or Skype. Because you have built-in Wi-Fi, you can make Skype calls and chats from any covered area, plus you can go on the internet using IE and check your e-mails with Outlook. I have also read that the Skype software that runs on dedicated phones like the Netgear and the Belkin is very crude due to the lack of processing power, whereas with a Windows CE-based device you have much faster processors that allow a Skype software closer to the one used on PCs.\n",
       "For those of you alergic to Windows, just wait for the Skype for Symbian release and buy a Nokia or SonyEricsson smartphone.\n",
       "Bottom line: Skype is too good an application to be wasted on poorly designed hardware\n",

       "I bought this printer about 4 months ago.  The prints are beautiful, and the speed quite good as well.  However, I felt compelled to write a review tonight because of the constant error messages that pop up saying that there are too many ink cartridges of \"X\" color installed.  It happens now between every print job, forcing me to open the printer, pull out and re-install one to three of the tanks, and then print my document.  There is something wrong with this thing, and I don't appear to be the first experiencing it.  Figures... I wait eight years to replace my printer, and end up with one that malfunctions!

       "I love the basic design, great hardware/software linkage, and software interface of this Mac-happy scanner.  However, I value my time too much to babysit the feed mechanism of the unit I received last week.  It inconsistently graps multiple pages as other reviewers have disclosed.  So, if you're scanning a 10-page doc and it misses one somewhere along the way, have you really accomplished anything?  No.  You must either try the whole thing again (with likely the same result), or you must figure out what page(s) is missing, scan it separately, and go thru a simple yet not expedient Acrobat process to insert the omitted page.  In the end, this machine made it +90% of the way to being a really great product, but the shortcoming fouls half the machine's overall utility.  Swing a little bit harder next time Fujitsu\n",

       "I bought this machine on August 3, 2005 and within one week of using it (as an outgoing fax only), there was a machine error.  I called customer service and after being on hold for 23 minutes I was able to speak with a live representative.  I was told that the machine would need to be replaced.  They sent me a REFURBISHED unit (the warranty indicates that any replacement units will be refurbished units).  They sent the base unit only, so I had to remove the drum unit, paper tray, and handset from the original fax machine to use with the replacement unit.  So, after only a couple of hours of using the replacement unit, I was back on hold to report another machine error.  12 minutes and I finally get a rep.  Apparently, the drum unit (which is less than one month old) is bad.  So now I'm waiting for the replacement drum unit.  DON'T EVER BUY A BROTHER MACHINE.  THEY'RE HORRIBLE MACHINES AND TRYING TO GET THROUGH TO CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY, VERY TIME CONSUMING\n",

But the sad fact is, when you recieve it you will NOT find an adapter for the iPod Mini in the box although there are adapters for other iPods. When you read the instruction book you will find that you must purchase an adapter from Apple Computer to make it work. Calling Apple, I find that they no longer sell the adapter. When I called Griffin I was surprised to find that if you have any other iPod than Mini and the adapter is not in the box, they will send you one. They recommended that I return the RoadTrip, which is what I did. Save yourself the aggrevation -- if you have an iPod Mini stay away from Griffin Technology\n",

Without the firewall in place, I measured about 25Mbs download speed. When I installed the firewall in between the modem and one computer, download speed went down to 6.5Mbs. I also discovered that if the \"enable keyword blocking\" checkbox is enabled, the throughput went down to 5Mbs, EVEN IF THERE WERE NO KEYWORDS!\n",

       "...So I was satisfied with the noise-cancelling qualities. The cloth cable is very nice and doesn't tangle as much as the usual plastic ones. I liked not having to spend so much time untangling thes in the morning. The headphones I purchased come with 3 sizes of rubber cap earbud covers and I found only one to be suitable for my ears. Of course, after less than a month one of those earbuds fell off and now I can't use these earphones until I find a replacement somewhere, which is proving to be troublesome. Super. I didn't buy these on clearance at Target so that hurts my pocketbooks and I am very ANNOYED right now. In the meantime, I've returned to some $10 non-earbud headphones and I really miss the noise-cancelling quality of these Philips earbuds. Life sucks and I want to die because now I can hear everything going on around me during the morning commute on public transportation.\n",

I wonder if they gave us a mini jack like games systems use if it would work better on TVs that have the 3 jacks on the front. Games systems get good image quality so why is this so bad... No info on this from Monster. Looks like a very good product but I will return it unfortunately. I did discover though that I can use a stereo jack with R-L on one end and a mini jack on the ibook end to give me audio speakers on any TV or Stereo for my iTunes, and audio for a DVD that I am playing but I don't need to spend this much money to get that. If the image were good I would keep it. I would rather show my slide shows from the computer. The image was very bad..\n",

       "I have had this phone for about three years. I bought it primarily to use it as a good quality speaker-phone (with mute) for long conference calls. It was quite expensive (I paid $200 to get it) but here are what I have found to be its shortcomings: No caller-id display. This just baffles me. I get caller-Id on all other phones in the house except this one. I have tried every possible varient (resetted settings, disconnected other phones, etc.) but nothing works: I always get \"NO ID MESSAGE\" on the LCD. The second major shortcoming is that called-parties often complain about the feedback on the speakerphone. One way to reduce that is by lowering the volume significantly, but that sort-of defeats the purpose of having a good speakerphone. Another minor shortcoming is that the phone requires to be powered even though it is a corded-phone (hence will not work in case of emergencies). Finally, two connect two lines you have to use an ugly adapter.

       "I just purchased yesterday the Home Dock Deluxe for list price at a local retailer.  I read all the reviews, (most of them bad but I got it anyway) the menu on TV part being my motivation.  And so far, I am not feeling good about buying it...\n",

       "1.\tThe sound quality is very poor.  Almost every song has some distortion and sounds \"muffled\" along with a good hiss.  I thought I was listening to a 70's era cassette it was so bad!  I have a high end Sony/Infinity system and the poor sound is very noticeable.  In desperation (and checking to make sure my amp was working fine) I plugged in my Apple dock from my 4th Gen Photo 60gb and the standard Apple AV cable.  The sound problem disappeared, and was crystal clear.\n",
       "2.\tThe menus to not work properly.  My Nano 5gb seems to work OK, but my 60gb 4th Gen Photo does not.  The menus are rather slow, and the artist, or album, or song titles disappear at random.  Sometimes you can back up a level on the menu and you will see the data, but mostly it is just blank.  The cursor will scroll down as though there is data there, but nothing shows on the screen.  You can play the music from the blank screen, but it is pot luck as to what you will play as you cannot see any titles.  I like the idea, but VERY, VERY frustrating.\n",
       "3.\tThere is NO support at all from the DLO website. It just lets me download a PDF of the manual or to buy more accessories.  I did not even bother contacting them due to all the problems.   I am not impressed.  \n",
       "4.\tThere also all the other problems listed elsewhere, too light and build quality poor, annoying power LED on front, no artwork on TV menu etc...\n",
       "5.\tSo basically, it is WAY too expensive.  Not worth it.  Not even worth 10% of the price charged.\n",

First, the strap is horrible.  It keeps getting twisted and I have marks on my shoulder from where it cuts in to it.  2nd, it's REALLY heavy.  Lastly, there's all these compartments that don't do anything and mostly get in the way.  Like the phone add-on.  My phone doesn't fit in there, and even if it did, would I carry my phone on my bag? \n",

       "I hate this contraption and I stupidly let 30 days pass before I realized how much I hate it. Now I start every morning with a \"boy I hate this thing.\"  Why? well here are few reasons why: You cannot read the numbers unless you are within 18\" and to get a backlight you must depress \"any button\"---not a bad idea but horribly executed.  The backlight lasts four seconds--way too fast in the night and \"any button\" is a lie because you can't press \"stop\" nor the \"on\" for radio or cd without starting a whole other process which you then, in the dark, have to figure out how to terminate.  The cd player spends more time \"reading\" your cd than it does playing it.  The \"tuner/band\" button is very sensitive and lord knows what you will wake up to, the screech of a not tuned in AM station happens way too often.  The worst of it all was I called Eton to tell them how much I hated it, just thought they might want to know. I had a friendly conversation with a very nice receptionist who assured me they wanted me to be happy and would do something, but first she wanted me to talk to the engineer/designer.  So I waited a week for him to return my call and he was quite rude saying if there is nothing wrong with it (everything is wrong, but they don't count that) there is nothing they can do.  He offered to trade mine for a different one just the same and I said \"why bother.\"  It was a classic story of \"I made it so it is by definition without errors--now leave me alone,just buy it and be thrilled with my brilliant design\n",

Theres not hard reset button so i have to go without listening to music for the hour or so im in the gym then take it home plug it in the cpu to get it to unfreeze.

       "I had one of these a couple years ago. It worked very well for a few months. Then, all of a sudden, the left analog stick became non-responsive. It wouldn't work on any game I tried. After reading other reviews on the gamepad, I figured I just got one that was poorly made and that the analog stick problem I had was just one of those several ones that was bad. Since it was only $20, I just left it alone. Well...after going months without a gamepad, I decided to get another Logitech gamepad, the same one I had, and guess what. After literally ONE DAY, the right analog stick stuck and is completely unresponsive. So, as far as I'm concerned...they're all terrible controllers. PERIOD\n",

After days of persistance and me being as rude to them as they were to me, they agreed to take the product back, but I had to eat the first shipping charge, pay to ship it back to them and pay a 20% restocking fee (for thier error!!)

       "From day one, back in late August 2006, I've had problems with this router--which I bought only because my ISP wouldn't install an extra cable outlet in my apartment without written permission from my new landlord. Since I work from home, this wasn't an option at the time. I'm not a tech guy, I don't care much for gadgets, but I'm not stupid either, and I couldn't even get this thing set up without calling support due to lack of documentation and the assumption that everyone buying this router uses some version of Windows--I don't, I have an iMac. Once set up, the router worked fine for about a month, and then I started experiencing connectivity issues. I called support again and they figured out some issue with 'mac cloning' or some such, reset my static IP, and all was well for another week, when the same issue--losing connection with the router after 10-20 minutes online--arose again. So I called support AGAIN, got a guy after 7 minutes, but he directed me to their website to download a firmware update, and then basically hung up on me. Unacceptable. So I called back, sat on hold for 40+ minutes before being disconnected without ever speaking to anyone. Finally, after a third try, I got someone on the line and he got me to the firmware and helped me install it via their web interface, only for me to experience the same connectivity problem the very next day. My ISP is coming Tuesday to install another outlet. No documentation. The install CD is configured for Windows and wouldn't work in Mac OS X. Online help sucks. The 800 support line sucks. This product sucks. Do not buy it\n",

       "I purchased this router (not from Amazon) about 6 months ago when my 5-year-old, very reliable, router died. I purchased it locally and someone came out and installed it.  I have had numerous problems with this router since then.  It does not stay connected and there is actually no option for \"always on.\"  After having some other problems, I took it back and the vendor upgraded the firmware.  After that, it lost the setup information twice and the info had to be re-entered.  Then today, after being instructed to reset the router, it got stuck in a mode where it only wanted a firmware upgrade (there was no apparent way out of this).  So, I obtained the upgrade and according to the router message, it was updated successfully.  After that, I could not get the router to work at all.  I gave up and ordered an entirely different router (the same brand that I has used before with tremendous success).  My summary - save yourself time and aggravation and don't buy the Linksys WRT54G\n",

All I heard was static, no matter what frequency I tried this on.  I have yet to take a road trip with it, so maybe that will work better, but right now, I am not happy with the product.  Maybe the fact that I live in a city with radio stations on virtually every frequency has something to do with it, but it used to work on some frequencies, and now it just doesn't anymore.

I really hope amazon puts up a warning soon and I will do my best to try to get that done.

During the trip, there was quite a bit of interuption from hillsides and tall trees in the Pacific Northwest. I kind of wondered how well the reception would work in the city.

       "I bought this card more then a year ago. Overall I'm not impressed, and wouldn't buy it again. First of all, in ~30% of cases it crashes my Tungsten E. Secondly, the games are not that much fun. SimCity is EXTREMELY limited and not enjoyable to play at all. Honestly, I have more fun playing games I've downloaded for free. Final annoyance - the card is slimmer then a regular SD so it slides off easily from the slots of the hardcase making it easy to lose \n",

       "Have you ever heard the saying that something would cost you \"an arm and a leg\"? These cables cost that, your first son, and bidding rights to your estate. Don't get me wrong- Monster makes great cables. Let there be no confusion on this point. But they're just incredibly expensive, and this is made much worse with these cables.\n",
       "\n",
       "Several people have pointed out that the digital signal on HDMI cables must adhere to error-correction and certain standards (even a $10 cable cable must meet some specifications to even reach production)- and this is largely true. Unless BluRay implements new features that require new cables at some point in the future, there's really very little difference between HDMI cables. Yes, the gold-plated pins and other features will improve your connection a bit, but the improvement will be far less than you'd see between any other \"cheap\" versus \"designer\" cables on the market.\n",
       "\n",
       "But Monster cables really are made to a standard that makes some difference, and that's worth mentioning. This cable is built sturdy, so that none but the most harsh of treatment could ever damage it. And the shielding isn't just the usual electrical shielding- Monster cables are toughened to the point that I wouldn't doubt if they're certified against nuclear fallout. If you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an EMP strike, you're looking at the right cables.\n",
       "\n",
       "But for nearly all consumers, these cables cost 4x as much as alternatives, with no real plusses. At the very least, you can pick up a mid-grade cable (Sony, etc) at a mid-grade price ($40) to get the increased sturdiness and the gold-plated connections. And over these products, the Monster cables basically have nothing at all except their branding. Please do look up a cheaper alternative this time, and spend some of the extra money on an extra set of whatever tools you use to keep your screen clean. You'll get much better results with these tools than you will worrying about $100 HDMI cables\n",

The lightscribe worked really well, it was the first experience, so I came here for reviews on DVDR, I was told that the Verbatim is of top quality and the lightscribe picture is even better than the HP's, so I purchased the Verbatim 30pk, received today.  I was so excited, that I immediately burn two discs with the best setting, but both come out fuzzy and presented the \"out of focus\" dull feel, look terrible with no detail compared to the HP bonus disc. Is this a joke? This is my first Amazon review, can't help to vent my disappointment. Thanks for the super fast shipping anyway.\n",

You have to turn the drive off and back on for windows to find it again. I do not have this problem with any other usb drive only Lacie drives. You cannot use one as a backup for this very reason, copying large amounts of data will fail and you have to start over or copy in chunks. \n",

Do not buy one of these, there are many drives with longer warranties that are more reliable from better companies.\n",

It lacks any kind of high frequency response, and so sounds very boomy and full of bass, making it almost impossible to use. It also needs a foam cover, since any kind of slight wind movement makes it extremely noisy. I contacted Jabra about this product, but received no response. Maybe it would work better with a different phone, but definitely NOT with my Panasonic\n",

       "DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these. With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase. Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me \"sorry, tough luck.\" I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again. WRONG!\n",

       "From cellphone and also the pager era I began my love affair with Motorola.  Don't need to read much farther into my review to get to the meat of it.  Sometimes companies make a lousy product even though they have others that are great!  Don't Buy These!  They fall into the former category  \n",
       "\n",
       "I needed them quickly (to give my in-laws time to practice using them before we went on a cruise) so when I went to their house for the weekend I bought them from the hated \"Best Buy\".  I am returning all 4! (2 sets of 2 handsets).  Here was my experience:\n",
       "\n",
       "I went in and saw the Midland and the Cobra along side the Motorola.  Not knowing much of Midland, but recognizing Cobra from their history with low-end phones and electronics, I opted with the very stylish Motorola T6500R's.  I know.  Big Mistake!  I am a computer programmer and very intelligent, but when confronted with products I do not undestand, I go for the brand name.  Which is something that can be forgiven if, as now, you find out what the problem is and correct it.\n",
       "\n",
       "I took them home and recharged them.  First things first:  The feel in your hand.  EXCELLENT.  They feel as good as they look.  I purchased these to go on a cruise to the Mexican Riviera and to maintain contact both on the boat and in the ports: Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan and Cabo san Lucas.  We wanted to make sure we did not \"lose\" my in-laws (really!  I mean it!  No, really ....) \n",
       "\n",
       "Anyway. Charged them up and turned them on. They come with a plastic-encased group of 3 AA rechargable batteries that fit nicely (and only one way--they are keyed) in the dual-purpose battery compartment.  This is nice: if you are out and running around and your charge goes down, simply buy 3 AA alkaline batteries and go on your way.  There is no problem if you forget you have the NORMAL NON-RECHARGABLE AA batteries in the case if you put it in the charging stand.  Unlike other units, the physical metal conductors to charge the battery pack are actually built into the pack, not the handset.  If you put it batteries, the charger makes no connection to the handset. If you put in the rechargable battery pack, 2 silver contacts from the battery pack  contact the charging stand and VOILA the unit charges.  Fitting the handset into the recharger is a nightmare, though!  It must be generic and able to fit several different Motorola products (production outsourced to Giant Int'l Ltd--so if you thought this was a genuine Motorola built item, you are mistaken.  The entire Talkabout line are outsourced for production) as the dual-compartment charger has 2 inserts in each compartment and no indication of which one to use for the T6500R's.  I am a smart person though so I chose the one that looked like it best fit and inserted it.  Then I attempted to insert the T6500R's.  I say attempted because the bottom of the handset is rounded and thus does not seat well in any direction.  After you get it to EXACTLY the right position (look on the charger to watch for the LED to light up) the the hard part (of charging, that is) is over.\n",
       "\n",
       "Next item: Bad red LCD backed screen.  Hard to read in ANY light and impossible in the sunlight.  Settings were easy enough.  Channel, sub-channel, vibrate, NOAA broadcasts, etc.  However, the advertised QT (ensures no one can talk through your handset unless they are using a compatible Motorola handset) does not work unless you hit the PTT (push to talk) button (or the CALL button), wait about 3 seconds and begin speaking.  My in-laws are new to technology and are used to experiencing walkie-talkies when their kids were young.  Therefore this is unusual.  They automatically want to push the button and talk.  So, the first part of what they say is immediately lost. \n",
       "\n",
       "I say \"first part\".  I am assuming I actually caught a portion of what they said.  This brings me to the second major flaw.  This unit contains a HORRIBLE speaker.  If the volume is too low then you can't hear it.  Too high and it is garbled beyond your ability to understand it.  We were really hard-pressed to find a happy medium.  AND, in a noisy room, it would've been impossible to hear anything.\n",
       "\n",
       "Some merchants list these as 5 mile radios.  The packaging says 10.  The 1 watt GMRS suggests about 5-10.  We got less than 1.  Directly over a lake. In vehicles on the I-5, we drove less than 2 miles from their house  (which is DIRECTLY ON the interstate) and got no signal.  \n",
       "\n",
       "I got back to my house in San Jose (on top of Communications Hill...the largest \"hill\" in the area) and could not communicate to my spouse less than 1/2 mile away while he was coming up our road!\n",
       "\n",
       "Since the weekend, I have spent all my extra time on Amazon.com and Consumer Reports reviewing all the offerings.  (the latter, Consumer Reports' reviews are from July in 2002!) So, I think I am going to return these and purchase the Midland 5 watt GXT500's from Amazon.  Remember, doubling the wattage (in this case MORE than doubling) does not give double the signal.  As another others have stated, increasing wattage increases only another portion of the distance--ie: 2 watts to 4 watts does NOT double the distance the signal can reach.)\n",

After trying all the recommended solutions, the tech support suggested I request a warranty replacement/trade for the original version or simply get my money back.

       "When realtime traffic monitoring came to my city, I immediately started looking at solutions to help my wife's daily business driving (2-500 miles weekly, crisscrossing a 50-mile area through major traffic routes). I quickly settled on an automotive GPS with realtime traffic monitoring. There are not yet many choices in this area, so the options boiled down to this unit and the Garmin 2720. (These use FM radio for the traffic info; the XM-radio units like the TomTom 700 and Garmin 2730 had unacceptably high monthly costs since I don't want XM radio.)\n",
       "\n",
       "I chose the Cobra for its large screen and positive reviews in areas that were important to me. Its flawed routing ability was not a major issue as it was to be used in a well-known region. Address lookup and traffic monitoring were the primary needs.\n",
       "\n",
       "In short, I don't know much about how the Cobra performs because I was only able to use it for a few short test trips. This is because the mounting hardware is one of the most deficient pieces of engineering I have ever encountered in higher-end electronics gear:\n",
       "\n",
       "- The only mounting option is via suction cup, which in tests would adhere reliably only to nearly flat glass. A stick-on disc for attaching the suction cup is also provided, but I did not attempt to use it and would not trust it to be able to hold this heavy (1.25 pound) unit over the long run. If your vehicle does not have a flat section of windshield in a convenient location, you will have very few options for mounting this unit.\n",
       "\n",
       "- California law prohibits attaching things to the windshield, meaning that California users either need to risk a minor ticket or find an acceptable alternate mounting point. (Good luck to you: I was unable to find one in three different vehicles!) Compounding the problem is that the mount has a very limited positioning range and easily runs out of adjustment room for most potential mounting alternatives.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Cobra does not offer any other mounts or mounting accessories at all - no beanbag or friction mount, no clamp, no fixed-base mount, nothing. If there is any aftermarket option (RAM Mount, etc.) I was unable to find it. You are stuck with Cobra's proprietary mount unless you are willing to modify the unit or its mounting pieces and fabricate an adapter for a Garmin or RAM Mount base.\n",
       "\n",
       "I was *almost* willing to go the extra mile to make this unit work in my vehicle, even though the best solution would have been very awkward to dismount and remount, making it a potential theft target.\n",
       "\n",
       "The final straw was when I found that the traffic receiver was faulty and I was unable to get a reply from the manufacturer in a timely manner (two days now and counting...) Enough's enough; something was telling me that this unit wasn't the right choice.\n",
       "\n",
       "So this unit is being returned and I've already ordered a Garmin 2720 with GTM11 traffic receiver in replacement. The prices for the units through Amazon are nearly the same (especially when factoring in the costs for 15 months of traffic monitoring - the Cobra comes with three months and gets $60 per year after that, while the Garmin comes with 15 months and has the same annual cost after that - so you have to add $60 to the Cobra to get a truly equivalent price). Garmin also has excellent mounts with a range of attachment options, some of the best map and routing tools, and a long track record with GPS units. It does have a smaller screen and some complaints about the user interface, but at least I can mount it properly and be able to tuck it away and remount it easily to prevent theft.\n",
       "\n",
       "This unit gets two stars only because my brief experience with its function appears to live up to all the positive reviews - but overall, it's like a high-performance sports car with no wheels! I 100% recommend against it for California users and suggest that others try to lay hands on a sample unit to see if it can be properly mounted in your vehicle before laying out $750\n",

       "I have had two of these units.  I would definitely not recommend anyone buying the ML-300.  Save yourself some money and get something else.  Both of the units lasted only 14 months.  I did hardly any typing with them. Only multi-page forms and applications.  The printwheel motor failed on both of them and so did the electronic board for the keys.  Took in in to a repair center and was told it was not worth repairing.  Contacted Brother International USA and was told that the warranty was only good for 12 months.  Save yourself some money and buy a Big Chief table and a number 2 pencil. \n",

Cheap, tinny, bass-less sound that's like being plugged into a busted Walkman.  The buds themselves don't remain stable in the ear, so forget about using them while engaging in motion-involved activity (such as jogging, walking, head-bobbing, neck movement, etc).  These are by far the worst earbuds on the market.  How could Apple stoop so low?  Don't be fooled!  Do a Google search for these and you'll find that the vast majority out there considers this a horrible product.  You've been warned.\n",

The second replacement worked fine until I upgraded my router and switched from WEP to WPA. After the switch the camera would not connect to the router, switching back to WEP, of course worked. Linksys has replaced the camera 3 times for this issue, and with the last support call confirmed that there is a KNOWN problem with WPA encryption and this camera\n",

       "This router had 1/4th the range of my standard linksys G-router which suddenly burned out after less then a year.  The speed (when I could get a signal) was 1 to 11 Mbps, my old router held a steady 54Mbps.  I did need a range expander for my old one to cover my whole house, but I couldn't use it with this router.  The expander only works with the basic G-router, so no way to even boost the signal on this new one.  Support was a joke, couldn't get any help or explaination as to why the \"Expanded Range\" was so much less range the the previous \"unexpanded range\"  Bought another older version, and everything's great again.

       "This product is terrible and I'm going to return mine or throw it away.  It constantly wanders to places I don't want it to be or trails where I think it should be based on my usage of other mice.  At this point I consider it unusable.  I've tried it on several surfaces to see if it was a tracking problem, but noticed no real change in behavior.  I think what's happening is it keeps trying to go to sleep while I'm moving it, because the tracking is OK as long as I'm moving it very quickly, but when I'm trying to precision target something like an icon or a piece of text it starts jumping erratically.  I keep it about 6 inches from my laptop at all times, and the laptop isn't complaining about connection problems\n",

       "Got this antenna from my wife for my birthday; to go with my Roadmate 760 I just purchased.. The antenna we received was the AT-65 antenna. Instead of the large round antenna in the picture it was a small rectangular antenna (1 inch x 1 1/2 inch) with no indication that it was an actual Magellan antenna, on the unit itself. The package had a Magellan cardboard insert but this was definitely not the antenna pictured\n",

       "Using this product to communicate between motorcycles as promoted by the very fact that there are motorcycle headsets for your helmut available for these radios is clearly unsafe.  The distractions created by the radios having no range after about 100 feet can prove fatal for a motorcycle ryder due to a momentary lapse in concentration, just as it would be between a bike and a car.\n",
       "\n",
       "I purchased these radios as the better of the Midland lot - with an 18 mile range.  An outright lie.  I bought them to communicate between two motorcycles- either myself and my brother (after also purchasing 2 of the motorcycle helmut headstets), or between me on the bike and my girlfriend driving my jeep following me on a long distance ride.  We don't even get 100 feet out of them when the radios begin to breakup and are usless.  The range increases as long as you are not moving.  I haven't tested them while one user is moving on the road or on the highway and one user sitting stationary.  I intend to contact Midland about a full refund, but if they don't work when you are moving then what good are they?. \n",

       "I ordered the Passport X50 from Amazon to save the $18 shipping Escort Radar was charging. I was told by someone at Escort Radar that Amazon was an authorized reseller.\n",
       "\n",
       "After having my detector on for ten minutes (right out of the box), it did three \"SELF CAL\"s, then said \"SERVICE REQUIRED\". I called Escort Radar and was told \"If you let the car power up the unit when you start the car, the voltage can be all over the place and the unit gets confused. You must first start the car, and then use the thumbwheel to turn on the detector.\" It makes some sense, but if this is really the case, why don't they put those instructions in their manual? After trying this many times, the unit was \"still confused\", so I returned it for a replacement.\n",
       "\n",
       "My second detector worked for maybe thirty minutes before the same thing happened. This time Escort Radar told me \"if you leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter over night, this has been found to cause problems.\" Well my lighter power goes off when I turn off the ignition, so this doesn't apply. Escort Radar also told me that \"excessive heat\" has been causing them problems. Now we have had a few days of 100� heat, and I'm sure the car gets hotter parked in the sun, but the design engineers should have accounted for these conditions plus some margin when you design something that is supposed to work in a car. It gets a lot hotter in other parts of the country. There are no warnings in the manual about not using it above 90� or leaving it off in a hot car. You wouldn't design a ski that doesn't work below 35�, would you???\n",
       "\n",
       "The most troubling part of my conversation with Escort Radar service department was they told me Amazon is not an authorized reseller, and they have no idea where they are getting the units from. Furthermore, they will not honor any warranty nor will they ever repair the unit, not even for money.\n",

       "I ordered this unit with high expectations, lots of memory, expandable, multiple modes, from a well known company and an excellent price; how could I go wrong?.  Easily enough, as it turns out.  \n",
       "\n",
       "I was unable to load it and control the play lists.  Trying to use it in MTP mode always crashed the host (BSOD) so I reverted to MSD (Mass Storage Device) mode using drag and drop.\n",
       "\n",
       "Dragging a folder to the device was pointless.  Most of the time the files didn't even show up, and when they did they were scattered all over the place.  I copied 82 files from the Lord of the Rings set into a single folder, only 52 could be found even during play back, but they could be seen from \"My Computer\" on the host system.  After fooling around with it for a couple of hours I gave up and called SanDisk technical support certain they would be able to help me sort it out. \n",
       "\n",
       "I have to admit that I was pleased with their support even though in the end they were unable to resolve any of the problems other than by suggesting that the only way to use drag and drop was to dump everything into the MUSIC folder where it would play in whatever order the device wanted; a totally useless method. \n",
       "\n",
       "This was totally unsatisfactory since there was no control over the play list and no way to even find all of the files that would fit into 8+gb.  Imagine listening to the first movement of Swan Lake followed immediately by something from 9 Inch Nails, then maybe a Bach Cantata!. \n",
       "\n",
       "Using Media Player to sync did no better.  Creating a playlist (m3u) of 82 files and then syncing did exactly the same as drag and drop.  A hopeless mess, no play order, missing files and so on.  \n",
       "\n",
       "After spending 3 hours with SanDisk tech support we were both more than ready to quit.  The tech had no more idea that I did about how to solve the problems that plagued the player and we both gave it up as a bad job.\n",
       "\n",
       "This is little machine has plenty going for it in the specification, but it's hopelessly flawed in the implementation, and this is without complaining about the stiff control wheel or the overly small buttons.  \n",
       "\n",
       "Throughly frustrated, it was in the mail being returned less than 8 hours after I received it.  I just cannot recommend this player, it needs a through overhaul of the interface and firmware; and fixing the control wheel and buttons would be a plus as well.  As it stands, it's without merit as a player.\n",

       "I had high expectations for this product, having bought some of Sandisk's other products. The problem with the e280 is that Sandisk doesn't give users the control or the versatility over file management. For example, using it in the (mass storage) MSC USB mode, one is forced to create playlists in Windows Media Player. This works, but one of the drawbacks is that playlist creations can be plagued with files that have errors or are skipped. \n",
       "\n",
       "It would be far better if one could just drag folders and music mp3 files to the right folder and play them, with multiple folder levels. This would allow catogorizing music the way the user wishes; instead, Sandisk adopts an almost Microsoft mentality in its approach. \"It's our way or the highway.\" Once one masters creating playlists, they have to settle for dumping them all into one directory.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's too bad because reading the manual and reading the reviews, one can easily get the idea that the e200 series can be set up like just another USB storage device (including other, previous Sandisk products). Well, you can, but it won't make much difference if the device won't play.\n",

If you do want to hear music, you literally have to hold your ipod right next to the radio and stay perfectly still or all you'll get is static. I bought this online and received it and was so excited to use it. I was hesitant to buy it, seeing almost every review has said it doesn't work but I bought it anyway, don't buy it! Every review I've seen has negative feedback for this item, and I agree with everyone. I figured since Griffin made a new itrip, it would be better and work great. However, it is the total opposite from that. I do NOT recommend this product at all. Don't waste your time or money\n",

I didn't even use mine but maybe two hours per week.  Good thing my daughter's was within her one year period by a couple of days. She still had to pay $25.00  Now my husband and I have to just junk ours and buy something else.  Customer service is awful!!

       "I've had this MP3 player since it came out and, if anyone is still considering getting it, I must advise otherwise.  The MP3 player itself looks and feels great, and the navigational features are very easy to use.  The problem is that the player itself is extremely unreliable.  I have used 3 versions of this player (expecting each time that the player was simply faulty), and all of them glitch up terribly.  I constantly have to take my battery out to reset the player as it will freeze during normal play.  It also freezes half of the time that I try to sync with WMP.  In addition, sometimes it simply refuses to take deleted songs off of my H10's list of tracks (even though they no longer exist on the player).\n",

       "Finally, iRiver has terrible customer service and they do not even back their own products!  As a owner of two iRivers (H10 and the 120), I have seen for a while how they function: they will offer updates for their faulty firmware for about a month, and then they leave that product to produce a new one.  It seems like they have a new Mp3 player being introduced every few months.  Their customer service is extremely hard to get a hold of, and if you do, they will simply say you need to send it to the factory (occasionally you will get a rep that will actually send you a brand new one for free, though).\n",

Thus when the TV is pulled away from the wall, the set is not level and very annoying to look at. I don't believe this is a fault in the actual part, but the design of the arm.

The high price iMuffs MB210 from WI-GEAR gives a better promise with the ability to stop your iPod music and take a cellphone call with noise canceling microphone.  Its Bluetooth adapter fits cleaning on iPods with dock connectors, likely will not break as easily.  I sure hope Logiteh will follow suit in this trend\n",

       "I have had this TV for less than 90 days and bulb has burned out, I called Samsung support and the bulb is covered by warranty.  They said they would send my phone number to service center and they would contact me in no more than 72 hours.  72 hours later still no call, I again called Samsung and they said they would contact the service center again and I would be called in 24 hours, still no call.  This was repeated 5 times and each time I asked to be referred to another center but was told none existed in my area.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fianlly after 6 calls, Samsung referred me to another center.  I then called them and they sent up an appointment 3 days later.  Day of appointment technician called and told me from the problem I described when I made the appointment I needed a new bulb (duh) and he had ordered one this morning and would call to make another appointment once they received the bulb. I specifically asked if they had the bulb in stock when I made the appointment.  Why they didn't order the bulb when they first set up the appointment, I don't know.  I called Samsung again and was told bulbs are usually shipped within a week of the order.  Neither the words usually or week improved my impression of their support. My fear is that when the technician comes out to change the bulb he will find another part he has to order and I am back on the Samsung support merry-go-round again. \n",
       "\n",
       "Now I realize that even though the set does (did) have a good picture etc, if you can't see it, it doesn't matter. I now have a very expensive paperweight. For me Samsung support has been a black hole and I have yet to see any results after two weeks and no hope in sight for the near future.  What happens after the warranty is over and I have to pay for a new bulb every three months?  If this sounds like I am not very happy with the situation that is the truth.  I am tired of Samsung and the service centers being sorry for the problems and delays but then telling me there is nothing they can do at this point.  I agree, you solve the problem by doing the right thing the first time or the second time or third time etc I am hoping maybe the eighth time is the charm with my Samsung experience.\n",

Back to Staples it goes.  The installation appeared successful, but whenever I try to print, it says \"error - printer is busy\"  The so-called instruction manual for this is laughable.

I turned the machine off and when I switched it back on the carriage went to the far left and will not move, ie I cannot type or use the machine in any way. When the machine came two of the keys were knocked loose and I had to stick them back on. Now when I look at the machine I can see it is assymetrical...there is a 1/4 gap in the base, so it must have been dropped or damaged somewhere.  This is not acceptable but I have no way to contact whoever Mstasad is.  I have a huge project to do over the labor day weekend but I don't have a typewriter that works.

       "Got it home and it had poor focus. The center was ok but the sides were definitely out of focus. the next morning the focus problem was gone. Go figure. The big problem for me was the time it took to  change channels. A full 3 seconds. Went back to the store and found this is a common problem with tube tvs. Well I took it back and went to Walmart and got a Sanyo HT27546 for $270. Good set with quick channel change. It also has an optical digital outputwhich the Toshiba did not. The Sanyo also has a full one year warrenty. Sound on both TVs is fine. A small point. The Toshiba can not be set up to go to closed caption when you hit Mute\n",

       "I posted a review two weeks ago, but it hasn't appeared, so I'm trying again...I bought this lock two years ago.  It has always been difficult to remove.  (Note:  despite what some other reviewers seem to think, it does NOT have a motion detector - that's a different lock.)  Recently, the lock decided to remain firmly inside my iBook, despite my efforts to remove it.  After a fruitless call to Targus's customer support, I finally got it out.  That took over 30 minutes of struggle.  My next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw.  Apparently, the Targus lock is not a good fit for iBooks.  I'm going to send mine back and demand compensation.  If you own an iBook, I strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than Targus\n",

       "It's partly my fault, of course. I bought this to use on my motorcycle. I thought the small size, especially the flat body, would fit nicely into the top of a tank bag. I also bought a special handlebar mount for it. Unfortunately, I've had nothing but trouble with it. It's slow to acquire satellites and to recalculate routes. Whether you're driving a car or a motorcycle, it's not up to the task of keeping pace with changes in your route. Maybe it was intended for pedestrians only. The user interface for the GPS is not intuitive (at least, not for me), Worse still, it freezes often when trying to download maps and when deleting stored routes. The Garmin helpline in the UK could only tell me to reset the machine each time. Not very helpful. My guess is that the combination of palm PC and GPS was too much for Garmin to handle. They should probably just stick to GPS.\n",

There is no possible way of getting rid of the static unless you are the MP3 player below the transmitter, which is obviously dangerous while driving.  You can only tune it to four stations which are 88.1, 88.3, 88.5 and 88.7 which is absolutely pointless approach to an FM transmitter.  I seriously regret every buying this transmitter\n",

They lie telling you that you are saving a huge 1% but at the end you pay almost 20 dollars for each card that is more or less 35% more than anywhere else. Its a shame that they try to rip you off that way. BUY THEM AT THE APPLE STORE ON LINE, NO SHIPPING FEE !!!!!!!! YOU PAY ONLY FACE VALUE NOT A CENT MOR\n",

       "I bought this phone for a work-at-home situation.  I then discovered that the maximum number of characters I could enter into  a speed dial entry (the number itself, not the name) is 24 characters.  A telephone calling card number is 25 characters long, 26 if you program a pause (a space, for this phone) between the phone number and the card id/pin.  When I called Polycom about it, I was told that not everyone uses calling cards.  Funny.  I've been issued a calling card at every company for which I've worked (going back 25 years).  This is the only phone I've ever owned (well, since the 80's) into which I could not program my calling cards.  Pretty basic stuff for product marketing and development people to miss.\n",
       "\n",
       "On top of that, when I try and enter the calling card number and card id by hand, it never \"takes\" on the first try: the network doesn't recognize the card id and pin the first time I enter them.  I have to do it twice (I've tried this a number of times, and it's consistent).\n",
       "\n",
       "For that matter, the sound quality, especially through the headset (also purchased from polycom) is not that good.  Of course, that could be because the headset jack is \"loose.\"  You can easily move the jack from side to side, which makes the sound quality even worse. \n",
       "\n",
       "I regret having made this purchase.  I'm going to scrap it and look for a new one from a different manufacturer.  The only reason I gave it one star is because the site interface here won't let me give it no stars\n",

       "I've had this mouse for about a month...use it with my Mac G4 at home...and I'm exhausted. It feels very nice in the hand and I really like the scrolling ball feature (hence the 2 stars), but it's just not predictable. Sometimes it glides along smoothly, most other times it tracks across the monitor like you're mousing over pebbles. I've tried a number of different surfaces: desktop (light woodgrain); smooth, medium gray fabric mouse pad; mouse pad made specifically for optical mice (better than the other two) and I have even tried picking the thing up and shaking it to knock it into submission--to no avail. It still lags and I have a hard time honing in on an object to select it (or to check a box or pick up a puzzle piece in a jigsaw puzzle...)\n",

You shouldn't have to think about mousing when you're doing it, it should just happen--immediately and smoothly, corded or cordless. And a \"newer\" technology should work better that a gummed up \"old\" tracking ball mouse!\n",

It jerks one line at a time ... the clicking is quite loud I might add.  Also, I have to set the tracking speed very low because the cursor jerks all over the screen if I don't.  Sometimes just clicking on System Preferences corrects the problem, but if I had it to do over, I'd buy something else\n",

After config (the web UI constantly has problems with cookies and forced you to re-login) the system would work. One quark was the IP address field for the radius server wouldn't accept more than one character in the forms. Up and running. However, upon reboot, the WG302 loses it Radius info and then cannot authenticate a client again. SHOWSTOPPER. After logging this with Netgear support - their response is this is an unsupported config and requires premium support. While this would be fine if it was a config issue, it's not ok given they claim support for these features and this was a required feature for purchase. They give no further support now.\n",

       "My very first cell phone was Motorola, and it served me great, so I became attached to the brand based on that experience ,and for that reason alone bought  Motorola SD4591 Digital Corded/Cordless System.  As we've put the wireless network in house the cordless phone started playing tricks. The battery life got very short very soon too. I was told I need to get different batteries NiH instead of NiCD. Naturally the microwave was playing the tricks on cordless too. As we have two lines in house and was told by several people to move to 5.8Hz 2 line phone I decided to get Motorola MD7091 5.8GHz Digital 2-line Phone and remained loyal to Motorola. And boy was I wrong again. What others are saying about caller ID not showing as soon as I have another phone on the same line besides Motorola MD 7091 is true in my case too. I don't get it does Motorola expect us to switch phones to their system now around the house if we want to used one of their phones??? This is really cheap trick\n",
       "\n",
       "Naturally, I could blame all this on poor quality of NiCD batteries, Wireless Network, Microwaves and phone company, and other brands' phones connected to my line. But what is the common thread through the entire ordeal: MOTOROLA. I will give other brands a try now, not yet sure which ones\n",

       "ipods are the leading sellers of portable players and everybody knows that but guess what ipod does not support the leading and best quality video format divx and avi hmm thats kinda retarded no? if any of you out there use file sharing programs such as limewire or any torrent programs if u download any of those videos the best ones and the majority are divx and avi too bad for you unless ur willing to sit around for an hour or two and convert your video to mpeg4. Also the video you convert may have a few complications, the audio and video may not be sychronized...at all and for those of you who have already purchased this piece of garbage im sorry and i have great sympathy for you so if ud like a program that will convert ur video for free and results in pretty good quality go to download.com and search for jodix video converter. This is not from speculations I have experienced this all myself with my own purchase of the video ipod and was a decision i regreted. Suggestion check out the creative zen vision M sure it may be thicker but the price is amazing for its features and conveniences of transfering files into it\n",

My Ipod didn't have that damage, it has only a few scratches on the screen. After lots of calls and fight they told me that to fix it I would have to pay US$250.00 that is almost what it cost new.

       "Got it and plugged it into my IPod and there was a major incompatibility.  The screen showed up that their was a voice recorder in the IPod but when I went to record I received an error message that the IPod could not locate a microphone.  Perhaps an IPod problem?  The Ipod is a 4th Generation 40 gig that is fully updated.  I think Belkin needs to engineer the recorders to work with all the new IPods, with the exception of the minis.  Have not been able to resolve the issue. I am sure IPod will state that it is a Belkin problem and that Belkin will throw the ball back to IPod????\n",

       "I just received my pair today, and I have to say, I'm extremely dissapointed. Yes, they are comfortable, but the bass is almost absent, no matter how far you jam them into your ears, the bass isn't nearly what it were hyped to be, it definently isn't enough for the amount of mid &amp; hi's they produce. Unless you like your bass to a minimum and treble to a max, I'd recommend another pair of earphones. If you're just looking for comfort and you don't like hardly any bass, these are your headphones. But, as others said, you can find much better earphones for a much lower price\n",

       "This hardware is well-made and I have heard very good things about the non-bluetooth version of the mouse. When it's connected and working, it does its job very well. Unfortuntately the MX5000 set suffers from some very poorly made software that makes it very difficult to use effectively. At seemingly random intervals, the mouse will start lagging or stop altogether. If this happens during gameplay, you're in a bad way. The keyboard also suffers from a truly annoying bug. When it comes off of its sleep state, it will double the first key you press. I have also had the keyboard just reset out of the blue. Add in that the SetPoint software for the LCD screen only fully works with two pieces of software (MusicMatch and Windows Messenger), and you have a very disappointing desktop package. The MX1000 is a great mouse on its own, but stay away from this Bluetooth combo. It is unstable and very frustrating to use\n",

       "I had Vonage since April, 2006.  I finally switched back to Qwest after unending problems and hours and hours on the phone (my cell phone, as my Vonage line didn't work) with tech support.  Here is my experience:\n",
       "\n",
       "1) It took about 2 months and about 2 hours on the phone for them to switch my existing phone # over to Vonage.  Don't be too excited about getting the first month free- if your moving an existing number it will take about that long to get it switched over.\n",
       "\n",
       "2) After my number was finally switched over, outgoing calls were constantly being dropped after about 20-30 seconds.  Incoming calls would also be dropped occasionally after about a minute.  This resulted in having to call the person back, saying \"sorry the call was dropped- we switched to this cheaper phone service and have been having problems....\"\n",
       "This is with the highest speed cable internet service available (8mbps download, 600kbps upload) and a wireless 'g' system which has provided top notch internet service consistently while I had Vonage problems.  I spent no less than 4 - 5 calls and over 5 hours on the phone with tech support trying to fix the problem.  After talking with tech support, sometimes the problem would be fixed temporarily- while I was on the phone with them- but return shortly thereafter.\n",
       "\n",
       "3) As a result of the problems I had, I asked to be credited for the months in which my phone service was not working.  Be warned, they are very hard-nosed about providing any credits for poor or no service.  I spoke to a tech support person about getting a credit for a month of no service, and he told me to wait until the problem had been fixed so they could determine how much credit should be given.  After the problem had been fixed (temporarily), I called back and they told me they could only provide credit for the current month, not previous months of no or poor service.  THEY ARE NOT CUSTOMER FRIENDLY ABOUT PROVIDING REFUNDS FOR POOR OR NO SERVICE.\n",
       "\n",
       "4) Finally, in September, still with dropped calls from Vonage, I switched back to Qwest to get reliable phone service.  I found customer service there has improved and is much better than Vonage.  And they gave me 3 months free promotion for coming back.  \n",
       "\n",
       "In the end, I am happy to pay the extra $10/month (after the first 3 months free) to get phone service that works.  I notice that $5 of the extra cost is for fees, etc. that the phone company has to charge but Vonage does not, which is unfortunate.  In any case, I guess you get what you pay for.\n",
       "\n",
       "One last thing: Vonage has never made a profit and many business analysts say with their current business plan, they never will.  This means eventually they will either go out of business, or have to raise rates.\n",
       "\n",
       "Save yourself the problems I had- pay the extra $ to get phone service that works\n",

Look at the picture and you will see what I mean -- the DELETE key is double-size and takes up the space where the insert key would be; INSERT is moved above the home key and is a little recessed round button.  ESCAPE is in the usual place, but it too is a little button instead of a legitimate key.  Very annoying.  Definately returning it\n",

I may have had too high of expectations, but these things put out NO bass whatsoever (it just sounds muffled and cruddy), and the overall sound is extremely poor.  I'm really surprised as I've owned JBL speakers in my car that I was extremely pleased with, so I'm amazed at the lacking quality in these.  I would recommend either finding another similarly priced set with good reviews or paying a little extra and getting something with a sub included\n",

Also whoever designed the Volume/On/Off knob is an idiot. The thing is so streamlined and slippery that when you try to turn it, the whole speaker just slips away from you. They're so light that they don't have enough resistance to stay put. So you have to hold it in place with one hand while you turn the knob with the other (unless you velcro them to your desk or something). Too bad because - like I said - they sound great\n",
